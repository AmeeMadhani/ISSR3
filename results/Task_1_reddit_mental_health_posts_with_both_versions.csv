good supportive experience theyve primed person vulnerable abusers sort cognitive priming tends particularly effective someones state mentalhealth crisis people rely heuristics critical reasoning ops want talk privately posting wideopen anonymous forum like reddit might best option although dont recommend allow ops request private contact asking support want please keep expectations realistic careful look history anyone offers pm opening,our mostbroken and leastunderstood rules is helpers may not invite private contact as a first resort so weve made a new wiki to explain it we understand that most people who reply immediately to an op with an invitation to talk privately mean only to help but this type of response usually leads to either disappointment or disaster it usually works out quite differently here than when you say pm me anytime in a casual social context we have huge admiration and appreciation for the goodwill and good citizenship of so many of you who support others here and flag inappropriate content even more so because we know that so many of you are struggling yourselves were hard at work behind the scenes on more information and resources to make it easier to give and get quality help here this is just a small start our new wiki page explains in detail why its much better to respond in public comments at least until youve gotten to know someone it will be maintained at rdepressionwikiprivatecontact and the full text of the current version is below summary anyone who while acting as a helper invites or accepts private contact ie pms chat or any kind of offsite communication early in the conversion is showing either bad intentions or bad judgement either way its unwise to trust them pm me anytime seems like a kind and generous offer and it might be perfectly wellmeaning but unless and until a solid rapport has been established its just not a wise idea here are some points to consider before you offer or accept an invitation to communicate privately by posting supportive replies publicly youll help more people than just the op if your responses are of good quality youll educate and inspire other helpers the rule applies here as much as it does anywhere else on the internet people who are struggling with serious mentalhealth issues often justifiably have a low tolerance for disappointment and a highlevel of everchanging emotional need unless the helper is able to make a commitment to be there for them in every way for as long as necessary offering a personal inbox as a resource is likely to do more harm than good this is why mentalhealth crisisline responders usually dont give their names and callers arent allowed to request specific responders its much healthier and safer for the callers to develop a relationship with the agency as a whole analogously its much safer and healthier for our ops to develop a relationship with the community as a whole even trained responders are generally not allowed to work highintensity situations alone its partly about availability but its mostly about wider perspective and preventing compassion fatigue if a helper gets in over their head with someone whose mentalhealth issues including suicidality which is often comorbid with depression escalate in a pm conversation its much harder for others including the rdepression and rsuicidewatch moderators to help contrary to common assumptions moderators cant see or police pms in our observation over many years the people who say pm me the most are consistently the ones with the least understanding of mentalhealth issues and mentalhealth support we all have gaps in our knowledge and in our ability to communicate effectively community input mitigates these limitations theres no reason why someone whos truly here to help would want to hide their responses from community scrutiny if helpers are concerned about their own privacy keep in mind that selfdisclosure when used supportively is more about the feelings than the details and that we have no problem here with the use of altthrowaway accounts and have no restrictions on account age or karma we all know the internet is used by some people to exploit or abuse others these people do want to hide their deceptive and manipulative responses from everyone except their victims there are many of them who specifically target those who are vulnerable because of mentalhealth issues if a helper invites an op to talk privately and gives them a good supportive experience theyve primed that person to be more vulnerable to abusers this sort of cognitive priming tends to be particularly effective when someones in a state of mentalhealth crisis when people rely more on heuristics than critical reasoning if ops want to talk privately posting on a wideopen anonymous forum like reddit might not be the best option although we dont recommend it we do allow ops to request private contact when asking for support if you want to do this please keep your expectations realistic and to have a careful look at the history of anyone who offers to pm before opening up to them,2363,177

long family history depression live mothers house fathers house yeah know im nearly take prozac daily usually smoke joint bed years worst experiences life ive come side back feet im back school months work ive given conditional acceptance university dreams provided maintain current grades girlfriend already attending university good relationship parents parents also good relationship one another despite separated cook clean run errands also good hobbies playing bass playing guitar producing music reading drawing feel confident ever yet reason feel like shit time finally opportunity achieve things dreamed kid yet motivation energy takes everything drag bed morning walk ass school come home lay bed staring ceiling fan schoolwork online plenty shit could reason every day plays like spend hours laying nothing im annoyed want make music want write papers want sketch drawings never im fairly used feeling unmotivated said earlier diagnosed young age ive dealt every symptom imagine times thought grown person thought tamed dragon speak unfortunately longer seems case im worried bout ruin life good ive fair share troubles consider lucky family opportunities theyve given want go beyond gnawing voice head wants nothing someone asks dont therapist yes ive multiple inconvenience support sorry im allowed post like say things ive said never talk mental illness anyone people excluding parents completely unaware mentally ill dont really know talk long story short life good im still depressed im worried itll fuck everything ive working dont expect anyone solution needed somewhere vent thoughts anonymously know people probably dealing way worse shit im sorry sound unappreciative life privileges idea feel way im tired staring goddamn fan,life is great still depressed hello reddit i almost never use this app and its even rarer that i make a post but i dont have anyone else to talk to about this im yrs old canadian and come from a lower middle class background i was diagnosed with mdd as an yr old and i have a long family history of depression i live between my mothers house and my fathers house yeah i know i should be out on my own im nearly there i take prozac daily and usually smoke a joint before bed after a few years of some of the worst experiences of my life ive come out the other side back on my feet im back in school and after a few months of work ive been given conditional acceptance to the university of my dreams provided that i maintain my current grades and my girlfriend is already attending the same university i have a good relationship with both of my parents my parents also have a good relationship with one another despite being separated and i cook clean and run errands for them i also have some good hobbies such as playing bass playing guitar producing music reading and drawing i feel more confident in myself than i ever have before and yet for some reason i feel like shit all the time i finally have an opportunity to achieve some of the things i dreamed of as a kid and yet i have no motivation or energy it takes everything i have to drag myself out of bed in the morning and walk my ass to school then i come home and just lay on my bed staring at the ceiling fan i have more schoolwork to do online and plenty of other shit i could be doing too but for some reason every day plays out like this i spend hours just laying there doing nothing im annoyed because i want to make music i want to write papers i want to sketch drawings but i never do im fairly used to feeling unmotivated because as i said earlier i was diagnosed from a young age and ive dealt with every symptom you can imagine times over but i thought that i had grown as a person i thought that i had tamed the dragon so to speak unfortunately that no longer seems to be the case and im worried that this bout will ruin my life for good ive had my fair share of troubles but i consider myself very lucky to have the family that i have and the opportunities theyve given me i want to go above and beyond but that gnawing voice in my head wants me to just do nothing and before someone asks no i dont have a therapist yes ive had multiple before but it was more of an inconvenience for me than a support sorry if im not allowed to post like this or say the things ive said i never talk about mental illness with anyone and most people excluding my parents are completely unaware of me being mentally ill so i dont really know how to talk about this long story short life is good but im still depressed and im worried that itll fuck up everything ive been working for i dont expect anyone to have a solution but i needed somewhere to vent my thoughts anonymously i know that people here are probably dealing with way worse shit than me so im sorry if i sound unappreciative of my life and the privileges i have i just have no idea why i feel this way and im tired of staring at that goddamn fan,3,5

able think otherwise apparently go back living trying prove wrong seems like im going live future eventually meeting woman feel like resignation future kids look sometimes think another woman wife hope im looking forward life anymore seems like love life completely ruined important part looking forward cant cope ruins everything,how can i want to live again hello everyone thank you for opening this post ive been badly depressed for a year and a half now months ago i dumped my ex girlfriend it was a short relationship but she was all i had ever wished for she was smart very educated very kind and loving to me she was expressing to me how happy she was to have found me i was her first boyfriend and she was giving me time to figure out how i wanted things to be between us shes also the most gorgeous girl ive ever met in my life perfect face a crazy bright smile that made me feel like the luckiest man alive and the body of a a porn actress sorry for the way im putting it but i was just crazy about her all around i was constantly thinking that i was the luckiest man alive unfortunately i dont like myself very much and i was probably thinking that she was too much for me i was also not in my best state mentally when i met her i also have a long story of sabotaging everything that is good in my life and this was no exception i dumped her after a few weeks although i was the one crying the most because i was feeling like i hadnt been the boyfriend that a girl as exceptional as her deserved i didnt want to spend one more night with her showing her that i was doubting my ability to commit to her i could have simply expressed my doubts by having a talk but ive always struggled with communication im impulsive i jumped directly to the most extreme solution to express my feelings ive come back to her a few times since then but she rejected me each time which i understand ever since that mistake i havent been able to live i cant find joy in anything i used to dance play music sing run hike climb work well cook for the people i like organize activities with friends shortly put i used to like living i used to be sociable and happy and i was radiating that energy around me ive become a alcoholic depressed in his room playing video games sleeping during the day unable to function unable to work properly unable to show joy no activity makes me enthusiastic i just dont have the energy to do anything im constantly thinking about her and the regret has been so hard ive often hit myself in the face to the point of having bruises or bleeding from my mouth i cant believe for one second that ill ever meet anyone else that will be able to replace her in my eyes ever since the breakup ive had a lot of flings and casual sex but it always made me even more depressed as it appears clearly every time that they are all so far to attracting me as much as my ex did i also have to live for the rest of my life with the deep regret and guilt of my mistake and the what if i had stayed with her i didnt even have the time to see any flaw in her im going to live for the rest of my life with an image of her as that of a perfect girl that i could have had a perfect life with even if thats not true my brain just has no material to feed on to be able to think otherwise now i should apparently go back to living and trying to prove myself wrong but to me it seems like im just going to live with my future being eventually meeting a woman that will feel to me like a resignation having future kids that i will look at sometimes and think that i should have had them with another woman than my wife i have no hope im not looking forward to life anymore it seems to me like my love life is completely ruined and this is such an important part of what i was

clingy and thinks im her actual biological mom lots of friends close friends casual friends peers and acquaintances from high school group of about who would be genuinely truly destroyed undergrad prob law school maybe who would be destroyed who i think would be pretty fucked up by it unsuccessful suicide attempt in undergrad and the guy who saved me would probably be fucked up if he found out i really did it this time reasons to take the out depressed my entire life and its never gotten better have tried therapy meds lifestyle changes emotional support animal reaching out more al anon support groups etc and none of it has helped broke up with my ex fiance last year who never apologized after sexually abusing me for two straight years would also threaten me manipulate me stalk me throw shit around drive dangerously to scare me disastrous situationship in law school which i thought was my chance to finally date normally ended badly guy wont talk to me and it was so bad that i lost of my bodyweight in months bmi to listened to my grandfather my best friend die on the phone and beg for me to come back i knew i couldnt make it in time so i lied and told him i was on my way and to go to sleep he couldnt breathe on the phone think about that sound him gasping like that probably times per day cant really take it anymore drugged raped and recorded on new years total stranger didnt report or anything because i figured no one would really listen an accurate sense given what i know about the law from law school hooked up with a classmate in february and he backhanded me out of nowhere and gave me a concussion also didnt report per the above point on failures in the law per the above experiences plus ex fiance plus situationship general sense that im always going to find new ways to be hurt by the male species general sense that i was raped as a child got high a few years ago and had a visceral memory of the sensation and a particular face but no real memory of what happened if anything per the above point general sense that im going slowly insane per everything above general inability to say any of it out loud cant even tell my therapist about new years or my grandfather genuinely haunted by that every second method exit bag oven bag duct tape tube helium tank leave the bag slightly open at the bottom to allow carbon monoxide to escape should be fairly quick and painless helium will fill the bag top to bottom unconscious in minutes dead in probably do it in the bathroom of a local building or a park graphic and awful for whoever finds me but spares my roommates that specific trauma alternative if i wimp out bridge in my city get so drunk im not afraid to jump higher likelihood of failure on this one thoughts also to be clear i know suicide is a permanent solution to a temporary problem i also know that suicidality is more frequently the experience of wanting to be painfree rather than wanting to be dead i dont really see a real way to be painfree other than this hence the post im a rational adult person and i dont really want highly emotional poetic responses about the meaning of life,1,4

caused get upset walk eventually apologised guilt equally constantly suffer guilt pretending everything fine lying avoid guilt know fucking stupid makes absolutely sense wish aware fact cure really really care want happy live together done year job close live lives far away family friends feel constantly guilty due fact want live closer home happier cant really try make happen due feeling digging hole even deeper adding illusion moving across country break feels like cruel joke yet cant even talk im feeling honest save pain wasting time brain wont let absolutely terrified outcome due fact lives far away friends family though feel like nowhere go happen also couldnt instantly leave current job would give notice moving back home weeks would stay dont idea would go would brutal us honestly dont really know feel cant talk anybody real life case gets back way worst case scenario becomes reality anyway ends hurt upset witness feel boot guilt straight gut heart feel like would fold promise true stay anyway feel mentally weak im supposed grown man feel like coward like nothing like hand dealt never set mess anybody around hurt anybody really feel like something worth pursuing start time feeling faded feel like past abusive relationship included emotional abuse blackmail played big part fucking brain much theres much explanation still choose anything becomes excuse fully understand person wrong situation know could fixed deserves know go live life happier wasting time man cowardly tell really feel know exactly need feel like cant ive even spoken therapists idea suggest need know wish could genuinely honestly feels like literally cant like brain missing part healthy brain would allow happen anyway dont really expect anybody good advice anything also fully aware must sound pathetic illusion somehow isnt fault know likely need man wish knew honestly hope maybe sharing ether somehow feel bit better maybe brain start turn gears something time tell thanks,i feel stuck with my girlfriend and i dont see a way out guilt guilt is my kryptonite it leaves me paralysed and ironically even more guilty i feel stuck between intense examples of guilt and the longer i sit here the deeper the hole gets ive been with my partner for almost years now and as far as from the outside everything is fine she isnt abusive ive been with an abusive partner in the past and she is not that what she is though is unfortunately bad for my mental health she struggles with her own mental health issues and with her self image a lot she constantly craves reassurance and is as she admits herself very codependant i work as a support worker i feel like im good at my job due to my personality type but in my personal life it causes me hell and to worry way too much about other peoples feelings above my own i just dont really feel it anymore with her i havent for a while now but i keep it going because i can not face the idea of hurting her honestly i would rather be dumped times over than do the dumping it goes against my very being it feels literally impossible to me not in the sense of im scared to do it so im hesitating i mean like i am a robot and it is literally against how i am coded my brain will not allow this to happen it is just an impossibility there is a mental wall there i feel i cant talk to her about this as due to her own mental health and self esteem issues just the mention of not being about us would be the same as breaking up with her anyway and she would be shattered i have tried to mention things in the past such as how sometimes i feel like i dont get to really be myself and feel a bit controlled in the sense that i cant just relax and have to make sure she is okay all the time but this caused her to get very upset and walk off until i eventually apologised because guilt i equally constantly suffer from the guilt of pretending everything is fine and lying to her to avoid guilt i know its fucking stupid and makes absolutely no sense i wish just being aware of that fact was the cure to it i really do i really do care about her i want her to be happy we live together now have done for about over a year and she has a job close to where we now live she lives very far away from her family and friends and i feel constantly guilty due to this fact i want her to live closer to her home so she will be happier but i cant really try to make this happen due to the feeling that this will just be digging the hole even deeper and adding to the illusion all that moving across the country just to break up with her it feels like a cruel joke and yet i cant even talk to her about how im feeling and be honest and save her all this pain and wasting of time because my brain just wont let me and i am absolutely terrified of the outcome due to the fact that she lives far away from her friends and family though i feel like there will be nowhere for her to go if it did happen she also couldnt just instantly leave her current job and would have to give notice before moving back home so for a few weeks she would have to stay and i dont have any idea how that would go it would be brutal for both of us i honestly dont really know what to do i feel i cant talk to anybody in real life in case it gets back to her in some way as then the worst case scenario becomes reality anyway she ends up hurt and upset and i have to witness that and feel the boot of guilt straight to my gut and heart and i feel like i would fold and promise that its not true and stay with her anyway because i feel mentally weak im supposed to be a grown man i feel like i am just a coward but like there is nothing i can do about it like it was just the hand i was dealt i never set out to mess anybody around or hurt anybody i really did feel like there was something worth pursuing at the start but over time that feeling just faded i feel like my past abusive relationship that included emotional abuse and blackmail has played a big part in fucking my brain up so much but theres only so much an explanation can do for you if you still choose not to do anything about it it becomes an excuse i fully understand that the person in the wrong in this situation is me i know all this could be fixed by me and she deserves to know and she can go and live her life happier and not wasting her time with me a man too cowardly to tell her how i really feel i know exactly what i need to do but i just feel like i cant ive even spoken to therapists about this and they have no idea what to suggest other than i just need to do it i know i do i wish i could just do it but what do you do when it genuinely and honestly feels like you just literally cant like your brain is missing the part of a healthy brain that would allow that to happen anyway i dont really expect anybody to have any good advice or anything i am also fully aware that i must sound pathetic i am under no illusion that somehow this isnt my fault and i know i most likely just need to man up i just wish i knew how honestly i just hope that maybe by sharing this out into the ether i will somehow feel a bit better and maybe my brain will start to turn some gears or something but only time will tell thanks,2,3

expectation a word i can throw around casually yet an idea that dictates my every decision i convince myself that im doing things right or that im paving my way to success but am i no matter how well i think i do its never enough to rip out this parasite of a feeling thats always weighing me down like a hunger i can never satisfy a feeling of emptiness deep in my stomach and the back of my subconscious that tells me its never enough its a feeling that holds me down an expectation i feel like im constantly staring at myself telling myself im not good enough no matter what praise or affection i get is this feeling one cast by my own eyes whenever i look into a mirror or shame i feel every time those important to me look into my eyes i know that im ugly lazy selfish two faced a horrible friend an introvert unmotivated depressed angry addicted and fake yet its as if my heart cant handle it and my mind creates falsehoods to tell me im good enough i lie to myself and to friends pretending that im something im not i derive satisfaction from the way others people perceive me and that alone yet somehow the way i see myself overpowers what anyone tells me i always feel deep down that no matter who it is that they secretly think negative things of me i cant help but feeling empty it never improves never gets better it only gets worse every time someone tells me things that i want to hear yet im not ready for how many friendships how many things do i have to do wrong before the motivation to improve hits my ears how many times do i have to betray myself and corrupt my morals until i feel satisfied with the image in my mirror i cant stand to look at myself i tell myself im happy that im content and ive gotten pretty good at feining my mental state infront of people i smile yet its always a mask to pretend that im something im not i hate myself i truly cant say theres a single thing that i like about myself im stuck i keep coming back to my pond the second i catch a view of the ocean i enclose myself in my digital encounters in the comfort i can only find hidden behind a screen my parents were always right its my damn phone ive become so entranced in this person i want people to think i am that i fail to ever improve myself in any way i need help and im not sure what that means therapy fails to help me drugs fail to help me i only feel true comfort and safety behind the wall of a screen a moment in time where i dont have to be myself or i can confide in the fact that im not truly happy i keep betraying people to try and pull myself out of the pit of dissatisfaction im in even in moments where the consequences have no comparable worth to what ill lose i take it im drowning chained down by the subconscious image i make of myself i need a life raft even one that will sink shortly after i get stuck in moments whether i think it or not my minds always begging someone for help if i even get a hint of affection i lose my moral compass i look for a way to take that life raft so i can save myself the burden of losing myself to my emotions ive ruined far too many friendships with my mentality my mind its constantly stabbing me with these thoughts hoping someone notices enough to get me help to offer a hand to carry me out of this hole that i keep digging myself into im addicted to my mask writing this i can only think how disappointed i would be in myself as a kid i dont have many friends i push people away trying to chase after a solitary affection that can soothe my thoughts if even for a moment ive crammed myself into a box and locked myself away because im scared of being hurt worse i never got over my depression i never got over the feelings ive had i only learned how to fake my emotions until people would believe them i learned how to feel apathetic and pretend that its ok but the more i live like this the more i realize solitary moments of happiness are far from enough to break me free of the weights tied to my ankles i cant stand to look at myself anymore every momentary happiness ends up adding weight to this feeling every time im happy i get worse than before i get reminded of how shit my life is why do i have to feel like this i have amazing parents i may not have many friends but i have a few that are close yet i choose those momentary rafts of peace over the important things in my life ive gotten so used to this mask that i cant even cry over my losses even if i tried my hearts been shattered and i havent been able to find the courage to glue back the pieces i confide in where i feel safe every hint of someone not liking me somehow manages to break every ounce of this fake confidence ive built up for myself i just feel numb empty no matter who i lose i can always feign my happiness and pull myself up the ladder every rung i climb i leave behind a piece of my sanity i cant look at what ive made myself to be im a failure of a human being a douchebag friend a shadow of what i wanted to be years old yet i already want to give up on the rest of the time infront of me mia uriah caio mike matteo george jesus sebastian luna caitlyn dayne how many times do i have to fuck up everything with the people i love before i realize i need fucking help why do i only feel ok if im not in my own reality my memories only drag me down looking back at when everything was perfect just to remember how everything came crashing down how i lost everything i cant lose anymore im at the end of my string with a pair of scissors closing little by little every day im forcing myself through doors im not even remotely ready to go through im always anxious im always depressed im always stealing satisfaction from people i have everything i need to live a good life yet i cant manage to grasp a single thing to help anyone or myself i let every opportunity slip out of my fingers lay back and sleep trying not to think about living another day im unstable and i dont know what to do i cant help but feeling like a burden to everyone around me like a problem i want to be happy i want to build and keep relationships but how can i if all i can ever manage to do is push everything away im a loss away from breaking every time someone asks if im ok i have to sit back and lie through my teeth saying that im doing great im sorry to myself to everyone i cant take this shit much longer my mind is but a mirror and i cant stand looking at myself for another second its my fault and no one elses that i dug myself into this i just hope i can find a ladder before i put this shovel through my throat,4,4

correct think id uncomfortable whole time clear even though grown west issue extreme heat traditional food way living island life beautiful ive tried best open issue feeling like ill never fit anywhere even culture meeting family members greeted nothing non verbal judgement calling white im tan dark norm seems attack carry physical appearance regardless makes feel upset judge even knowing actually better anxiety crippling mute week finding hard speak make eye contact course makes look weird people socially laid back feels like im punished grew taught language white knowing culture relatives make offhand comments malice doesnt feel nice self esteem absolute gutter knew coming course would mums priority since hasnt years wants spend time family havent talked much since feel bit isolated today came asked could try happier enjoy time makes feel worse really trying feel really discouraged trip stirring feelings inadequacy already felt back home also feel bad back home element know presence plague happiness expressed disappointment saying leave early since youre happy makes feel like grateful suck sidenote feel incredibly sick think gi may bleeding dont want tell dont want burden hope something serious thatll kill since ive much coward back home past months hard graduated long ago ive found hard build life im unemployed dont license currently undergoing failing gap year safe say im failure compared siblings moved found contentment ive struggling self harm point addiction hard able feed intense desire punitive action think mum thought bringing would make happy distract embarrassing life live back home feel awful beautiful country loving mother instead ive crying every night know week itll soon anyway im feeling awful knowing come never born feeling follow wherever one home messaged nonmalicious intent im sure still im incredibly lonely defeated moment,i am a burden on the family trip for context ive been struggling with depression since i f was and my mum and i have travelled to the motherland for a week i never said i wanted to go but id probably never come back here otherwise and i also have nothing else to do so why not however i was correct to think id be uncomfortable the whole time to be clear even though i have grown up in the west i have no issue with the extreme heat the traditional food the way of living island life is beautiful ive tried my best to be as open as i can be my issue is feeling like ill never fit in anywhere not even my own culture meeting all these family members who have greeted me with nothing but non verbal judgement calling me white im too tan for the dark norm but it seems to be an attack on how i carry myself not my physical appearance regardless it makes me feel upset because they judge me before even knowing me not that who i actually am is any better my anxiety is crippling so i have been mute most of the week finding it hard to speak up and make eye contact this of course makes me look weird to people who are socially laid back being here feels like im being punished for how i grew up for not being taught the language for being too white knowing my culture relatives make these offhand comments with no malice but it doesnt feel nice when your self esteem is in the absolute gutter as is i knew that coming here of course i would not be my mums priority since she hasnt been here for years and wants to spend time with her family but we havent talked much since being here so i feel a bit isolated today she came to me and asked if i could try to be more happier and enjoy my time here which makes me feel worse because i really am trying but i just feel really discouraged with this trip stirring up feelings of inadequacy i already felt back home i also feel bad because being back home she is in her element and i know my presence here is a plague on her happiness she expressed disappointment in saying that we can leave early since youre not happy it makes me feel like i should just be grateful and suck it up sidenote i feel incredibly sick i think my gi may be bleeding but i dont want to tell her because i dont want to burden her i hope its something more serious thatll kill me since ive been too much of a coward to do it myself back home these past few months have been hard for me i graduated not too long ago and ive found it hard to build a life of my own im unemployed dont have a license and am currently undergoing a failing gap year so its safe to say im a failure compared to my siblings who have moved out and have found contentment ive been struggling with self harm to the point of addiction and so being here has been hard not being able to feed into my intense desire for punitive action i think my mum thought that bringing me here would make me happy and distract me and herself from the embarrassing life i live back home and i feel awful because being in a beautiful country with the loving mother that i have it should but instead ive just been crying every night being here i know its only a week and itll be over soon anyway but im feeling awful knowing that not only should i have not come but that i should have never been born as this feeling will follow me wherever i am no one at home has messaged me with nonmalicious intent im sure but still so im incredibly lonely and defeated at the moment,1,0

suffers from depression money never stretches far enough because im not organized with my finances and ive become a slave to my credit card i cant earn more money because i feel my abilities are limited i dont take on clients because im afraid of messing up im completely insecure about my knowledge but i also dont have the money to pursue a decent postgraduate degree or the motivation to study on my own ive gained about kilograms due to the medication and because i binge eat when im deeply depressed ive signed up for the gym several times but i dont go because i have no energy the trainers dont pay attention and i dont know anyone who could go with me i hate my appearance and can barely look at myself in the mirror i hooked up with a few women for a while but i realized i was using it as a way to escape my reality since then i havent been with anyone else and i have no interest or sexual desire anymore ive never been able to afford a car i recently managed to buy an old motorcycle by selling some equipment i had someone stole the license plate and i had to pay to get a new one it might not seem like a big deal but when youre broke every expense matters a few weeks ago i felt really sick and found out my liver is in bad shape i dont even drink alcohol on top of that i need surgery to remove my gallbladder and another surgery to fix a hernia i know how to do a lot of things but im not good at any of them im getting older and with each passing year it becomes less likely that ill achieve anything in my life its astonishing how everything goes wrong in my life every week something happens that makes me feel even worse than i already do i honestly dont know what to do anymore and i pray every day to have a heart attack and die soon because i cant take this miserable life anymore i cant take this endless suffering,2,3

living life years passing fast without accomplished anything,i have an easy life but i am still depressed hello this is my first time posting and i am too emotional right now so please bear with me even if its a mess its gon na be a long post before i start with my rant heres a little background about myself i am a female midtwenties from an ethnic minority living in europe for almost a decade i am blessed to have loving and caring parents who provide everything they can people from my country are going through tough times and i am privileged enough to live in a country where there is safety and opportunities i have always been privileged enough to not struggle too much even through hardships my parents sheilded us me and my sibling i didnt experience war i didnt get sexually abused experienced sh once but its irrelevant i didnt experience traumatic experiences nor lost someone close i grew up gifted and smart academically but my abilities degraded as i grew up now i am a university student years behind my peers because of my mental health issues it started with a mild depression i went to high school struggled a bit and was lonely yet i did okay academically i started uni as the pandemic started and ever since i couldnt perform well at school my grades are bad but i managed to reach my final year i study a relatively easy major yet i struggle academically i dont wan na get into identifiable details but i am failing due to my inability to do any school related work i feel sadness and anxiety all the time i feel like a failure and a lazy person because i cant do a simple thing like graduating university i have lost many friendships due to my inability to maintain constant communication or interactions i have an unhealthy relationship with food i struggle with showering regularly unless i have to leave the house i feel paralyzed most of the time and incapable of doing anything productive distracting myself with anything from watching tv to playing mobile games to reading fanfictions anything that stops my thoughts i lost passion i dont have hobbies or enjoy anything i live like a background character watching my life pass by i worked a part time job for a while and it was the most rewarding feeling to be able to be a useful productive human being but i had to quit because i cant afford any more distractions from my studies i live with my parents we arent in a great position economically and dont have a long term stable income this is one of the reasons i feel anxious a lot and that i need to become independent financially as fast as possible i tried to get help it was really hard to get myself to do something and the system in the country i live in makes it hard to get free mental healthcare i did get a psychiatrist to talk to they diagnosed me with aspergers which albeit helpful explained a lot not exactly what i wanted or needed the most i was seen by two doctors the first said i have anxiety and depression but didnt stay long enough to diagnose me officially the second is the one who gave me the aspergers diagnosis but when i brought up my anxiety they said that my anxiety symptoms are all related to my autism and they cant categorize it as generalized anxiety same goes for depression and i also brought up the possibility of having adhd too they said that i dont meet the criteria they have to get diagnosed through this service cheaper and provided by the government not that i have no symptoms neither confirmed nor denied its just i am not doing bad enough to warrant their intervention and then they were done they cant do anything more no mre counsling or anything after the diagnosis and now i am back to the same point helpless exhausted all affordable help and feeling worse about myself i keep doubting my aspergers diagnosis not because it doesnt resonate with me i just feel like maybe its something i made up to excuse not being social and struggling to fit in with the world i had multiple family members telling me i am keeping myself in this cycle of depression and self hatred it was implied by some that i am not trying hard enough that i will fail in life or go crazy if i dont free myself from these feelings i just feel stuck i have a loving family and an easy life yet i cant escape this constant sadness and unproductiveness i am ruining my life slowly missing deadlines and ruining my future career and i feel incapable of doing anything about it i cant even think about offing myself because i tried once and i saw how devastating and traumatic it was to my parents so i am stuck alive but not living my life and the years are passing by fast without me having accomplished anything,2,0

insurance imagine pocket costs would bring another thing bums anyone else experience existential dread one navigate life like im really hard time putting monkey suit lately im afraid itll slowly start deteriorating relationships well,hyper awareness is making me depressed i cant help but feel super bummed out and depressed over literally everything for example i was eating a bag of mms the other day which i love and i swear i began tasting food coloring it sent me down a rabbit hole realizing all of the small little chemicals that go into everything we eat in this country it sickened me and ive been bummed about it for a few days now because i cant enjoy any food or drink im hungry but the little devil on my shoulder reminds me of gmos artificial preservatives and then i just get really turned off to the idea of eating i realize the mms are a symbol for something larger but man i feel like i just cant find happiness anywhere these days and if its not the goddamn mms its something else my childhood experiences the way people interact with me etc i feel like im just hyper aware of things all of a sudden and it absolutely blows because im very aware of the fact that i am in charge of my own happiness and cant rely on finding it anywhere or that nobody is going to come save me normally i understand the ebbs and flows of life and the peaks and valleys that come with it but i really cant shake this one off not just the mms but ive lost interest in pretty much everything i was out with my fiance last night and normally i love being out walking around and general sightseeing but god i couldnt even enjoy it without the thought of thinking that everybody out including myself were merely just distracting ourselves from the reality that were all just pigs being led to slaughter its quite awful i dont necessarily have thoughts about committing suicide besides the normal curiosities that come with thinking about death but man i can not shake this overwhelming feeling that my life will never be my life again that im merely just existing in nothingness and that no matter what i do say or think theres already a predetermined outcome for me that i have no say in if we are being completely honest i dont really feel like i have anyone to turn to with these thoughts my fiance and i have tried talking about it but she thinks i am just overthinking things which she isnt wrong but its not really helping me and my friends dont really understand it either everyone just sits there listens to me and deduces that i need to relax and stop trying to over complicate things its easier said than done i get it but man does that advice really bum me out i feel like people just freak out over the words that come out of my mouth and dont really try to understand what im saying so they pile on some generic advice thats supposed to make me feel better so then i have to sit there for the rest of the time and pretend everything is sunshine and rainbows i have no idea what to do now id love to try talking to a therapist that can unbiasedly help me unpack all of this but i dont even have health insurance and can only imagine the out of pocket costs that would bring another thing that bums me out does anyone else experience this existential dread how does one navigate life like this im having a really hard time putting the monkey suit on lately and im afraid itll slowly start deteriorating my relationships and well being,3,3

change consistent effort requires much ive made somr efforts enough geting tired life dont fully beleive recovery possible part sees things lens thomas ligottis book conspiracy human race done,depression i have been depressed for a long time about years id say things have gotten worse and worse in the grand scheme part of me doesnt want to change i often feel indignant wen given advice insulted i think i have been gripping on hard to the idea that none of this is my fault for years i find it hard to do things for myself because of this feeling of entitlement i have i resent the very fact of birth i resent the fact i have to work and exert effort just to survive and that actual satisfactory survival seemingly requires even more effort i know this sounds stupid and melodramatic but i hate this very reality i hate everyone i hate myself i agree with the basic buddhist sentiment about suffering and i think our evolutionary psychology conspires with our environment to make this life a nightmare you can probably tell that i pity myself allot i only manage to accept responsibility for this life ein breif moments whenever i feel overwhelmed which is often i return to viewing life through this cold darwinian lense everything is pointless competition and struggle for survival and reproduction i start feeling so much envy hate regret when the sting of past failures touches me again i blame determinism i blame my parents i blame all of the people who have what i want because maybe they were all just environmentally and genetically lucky i have a therapist and he gives me these positive quotes to write about that have fucking typos its corny but i do it anyways because i feel like this pessimism thing hasnt taken me anywhere i cant really talk to him though there is such a heavy weight of things that i simply cant say to anyone i dont like anyone enough i hate my sexuality i definitely dont want to talk about that i hate what a lazy loser i am i hate how easily i give up i despise my past i feel like i am in hell i dont think this is ever going to get better i dont want to tell anyone anything because all i see is vulnerabilities i see other people as hostile envious unconscious resentful little survival units whenever they do something that seems nice i figure it is just their programming an attempt to inflate their ego for their compassionate nature or their is some ulterior motive maybe it is just programming just people doing nice things because that whats let you fit into society and thats how it evolved it seems so unsatisfyig so cold i wish there was some magic to it but i dont trust people at all i dont think they even know their own motivations half the time all of these garbage thoughts swirl endlessly around my head but my realworld life is no better i have lived a bad life devoid of the things people want and pursue i have not been corageous persistent and hopeful that has lead me to a life where i am years old and still a virgin for my entire life i have wanted a girlfreind but i have only asked out a girl twice it eats through me like acid the fact that ive been deprived of women and its only the result of cowardliness ineptitude a shitty brain its not like im qausimodo or something i just continuously made bad choices and only made small efforts to change i dont think i can really forgive myself for wasting all of those years most of the time i cant even consider the idea it was my own fault i think i am fundementally flawed when i tried to kill myself it was an act of petty revenge and unerious at that i endangered peoples lives in the course of that attempt by leading the police on a chase in my car i narrowly missed a jail sentence afterward i was assigned a psychiatrist by the court and she claimed that i had cluster b symptoms whatever that means i think more about those sinister words these days and i think i might just be one of those hopeless people a shitty person doomed by my inability to take responsibility for life always envying and pitying myself it changed me when i did that because i wonder what i am capable of whenever i have a hateful fhought or fantasy now it seems to mean more were all horrible people anyway arent we we take cheap tshirts and electronics made in sweatshops right what is a good person someone who is just nice to those in their immediate vicinity i am to tired to be a good person honestly i think all i want to do is wallow its just to fucking terrifying and hard to change the consistent effort it requires is so much ive made somr efforts not enough i am geting tired of life i dont fully beleive recovery is possible part of me sees things through the lens of thomas ligottis book the conspiracy against the human race its just done,1,2

bottleaswell horrible cocaine addict spiralling needed something help would go parties get blackout drunk id wake floor bathtub idea happened never hard drugs always scared bad inevitably introduced mushrooms even typing makes skin crawl chest ache friend thought itd good idea try first time time hit dealer knew hed done sold asked discount stupid drastically overestimated underestimated effects mushrooms thought natural whats harm bought gms told micro dose go g first time also told us absolutely take within week even monththis important cuz im stupid took back house sat floor bought scale day sure taking right amount first mistake taking gms aswell friend put crackers held minutes walls began melt soft everything hilarious good time minutes started getting stronger vision rainbow like completely lost touch earth body somehow ended dark laying next tripping bad point kept repeating water remind okay horrible debated life reason anything everything mind convinced death inevitable something fear inescapable scared friend ended peeing bed bad like coming dont know immediately feeling mushrooms ware wanted take friend said demanded dangerous sleep next day fine nothing felt course experience crazy dont know needed lowest guess next night invited different friend take mushrooms night thought id taken less would enjoyable especially knew expect second mistake weighed one gm dose one gm immediately taking threw worst feeling anxiety took body thrown everything point barely tripping enough freaking crying itching every inch body friend seemed get super high didnt want ruin especially since experience good finally coming anxiety slowly left body thanked god everything promised id never mushrooms falling asleep woke next morning fine bit shaken last time okay great trip great soon left chest began burn could think dying whats point everything useless itching brain every direction scared idea happening went dads immediately noticed third biggest mistake lied told anxiety didnt know never took things seriously told breathe basically continued weeks got worse day random waves dread anxiety death suicidal thoughts screaming inside brain finally came clean got sent mental hospital stayed impatient week couldnt sleep couldnt eat couldnt interact people family even felt unreal scary petrifying lost pounds throughout entire situation lost energy live fight ruined completely finally got released since never diagnosed ptsd manic depressive disorder diagnosed severe case psychosis never everyday fight life addiction weed still persists ive promised never touch anything harder weed take years behavioural therapy anger management put different medications hospital consistently even day get flashbacks trip get horrible anxiety attacks randomly everything different brain completely different used failed multiple classes im currently struggling job school hate life started one bad trip please please please safe smart take hallucinogens unless youre well informed mentally prepared consider everything youd lose reason chemicals didnt cooperate brain even low level drugs hugely dangerous,the biggest mistake of my life im f i have been smoking since i was it started with carts and it all went downhill from there i had a lot of shit happening in my life moving for the th time that summer losing my step mother of years she was like a mother to me my mom has always been halfway in a beer bottleaswell as a horrible cocaine addict i was spiralling and needed something to help i would go to parties and get blackout drunk id wake up on my floor or in my bathtub having no idea what happened i never did any hard drugs i was always too scared but it was just as bad inevitably i was introduced to mushrooms even typing this makes my skin crawl and my chest ache my friend and i thought itd be a good idea to try them for the first time i was at the time i hit up my dealer i knew hed done them and sold so i asked for a discount i was stupid i drastically overestimated myself and underestimated the effects of mushrooms i thought that it was all natural so whats the harm i bought gms from him he told me to micro dose not to go above g for my first time he also told us absolutely not to take them within a week of each other even a monththis is important cuz im stupid we took them back to my house and we both sat on the floor i has bought a scale that same day to be sure i was taking the right amount my first mistake was taking gms aswell as my friend we put them in crackers and held them down after about minutes the walls began to melt they were soft and everything was hilarious her and i had a good time for about minutes until it started getting stronger all my vision was rainbow like and i completely lost touch with the earth and my body somehow we both ended up in the dark laying down next to each other i was tripping bad at this point we kept repeating water to each other to remind ourselves we were okay but it was horrible i debated life and the reason for anything and everything my mind convinced me that death was inevitable and something i should fear its inescapable and i was so scared my friend ended up peeing the bed it was bad but by like am we were both coming out of it i dont know why but immediately feeling the mushrooms ware off i wanted to take more my friend said no and demanded it was dangerous and we should sleep next day was fine nothing felt off at all of course the experience was crazy but i dont know why i needed more i was at my lowest i guess but the next night i invited a different friend to take mushrooms with me that night i thought if id taken less it would have been more enjoyable especially because i knew what to expect my second mistake i weighed one gm dose and one gm for her immediately after taking them i threw up and the worst feeling of anxiety took over my body i had thrown everything up by that point so i was barely tripping but i was just enough to be freaking out after a while of me crying and itching every inch of my body my friend seemed to get super high i didnt want to ruin it for her especially since her experience was good finally i was coming down and the anxiety slowly left my body i thanked god for everything and promised id never do mushrooms again before falling asleep i woke up the next morning fine a bit more shaken then last time but i was okay she had a great trip which was great but as soon as she left my chest began to burn all i could think about was dying whats the point everything is useless and this itching in my brain in every direction i was so scared i had no idea what was happening i went to my dads and he immediately noticed i was off my third and biggest mistake i lied i told him it was just anxiety and i didnt know what to do he never took those things seriously so he just told me breathe basically this continued for weeks it got worse by the day random waves of dread and anxiety death and suicidal thoughts screaming from inside my brain finally i came clean and got sent to a mental hospital i stayed impatient for a week i couldnt sleep i couldnt eat i couldnt interact with people or my family even i felt so unreal it was scary petrifying i lost pounds throughout the entire situation i lost all my energy to live or fight it ruined me completely i finally got released but since then i have never been the same i was diagnosed with ptsd manic depressive disorder and i was diagnosed with a severe case of psychosis i have never been the same everyday is a fight for my life my addiction with weed still persists but ive promised to never touch anything harder than weed again i had to take years of behavioural therapy anger management i was put on different medications and was in and out of the hospital consistently even now to this day i get flashbacks of that trip i get horrible anxiety attacks randomly and everything is different my brain is completely different from how i used to be i failed multiple classes after that and im currently struggling with my job and my school i hate my life and it all started with one bad trip please please please be safe and smart do not take

basically paying drugs goes everything ive taught feels disgusting dismissive hypocritical telling stuff like stop helping good im afraid hes gon na de stop giving money keep giving money might de substance abuse keep slowly decaying im struggling accountable form life feels like im somewhat responsible someone else yeah edit sorry seems fact managed keep things short possible,abandoning a family member hello people of reddit tldr do i need to stop helpinggiving money to a family member struggling heavily with drug addiction ive created this altaccount because its something a little heavy that im not comfortable discussing on my main i hope its ok otherwise let me know if i should post elsewhere im considering cross posting on offmychest or something like that because its eating me im gon na try to keep things as short as possible to sum up the situation and get advice from you one of my cousinsm is suffering from drug addiction this is not about money but the issue came to light through money so im gon na mention it he started asking me for money about or years ago mostly always small amounts like and the occasional but very regularly sometimes a every weeks for a month for instance or directly filling up gas now this cousin has always struggled in his life whether with his professional life or nondrug related health issues failing to meet deadlines i had to pick him up several time in the middle of nowhere because he failed to fill up the gas tank etc im still at my parents so i can afford to help him and although i ended up resenting the regularity of it as a nuisance i still kept doing it genuinely waiting for him to bounce back etc he would sometimes pay me back because it was always very clear that the money was lent not gifted but never enough to clear the debt that kept slowly increasing i never pressured him about it i even told him that he could pay me back months later as im not strapped for cash due to me not having to pay a loanrent i offered to wire him a in one go to make it more comfortable and make sure to avoid bank penalties he always refused he always came back for the small amounts about months ago my dad his uncle caught on to it and thats basically when i learned that he started smoking weed as a teen probably then fell into worse things and went to rehab several times since then wasnt told absolutely everything but seems like its between and which holy sht to me seems like a lot i did come clean to my parents about the all recurring amounts and full sum not a crazy sum you can be at ease as well as to another cousin who im close with but who lives abroad turned out he also managed to get her to lend him money whenever she came home she was already aware about what she though was his past addiction even though ive been trying to play devils advocate saying we dont know if he fell back into it for sure etc etc everyone is pretty unanimous that given the frequency and the amounts his current physical and non professional state weve been basically bankrolling his drug use and that hes been constantly lying about basically everything to everyone i didnt stop giving him money as i think i was still a bit in denial or gaslighting myself into thinking he was working on himselfgonna get better anytime soon now the current situation i learnt that he self so he said checked in a rehab center last week which was amazing news as to me it showed he finally wanted to get better unfortunately he got kicked out of the program yesterday by the institution after like days max needless to say my disapointement was twice as big as the relief i had felt when he got hospitalised i wasam so shocked and dumbfounded that he only lasted this long heres how we found out his parents had just left for holidays abroad before knowing what happened on their first day they failed to reach him via a shitload of texts and missed calls since my cousin had a second set of their home keys for emergency they sent my father to check their house no answers to the doorbell front door unlocked loudly called form him several timesno answers checked all the rooms guestrooms they were a mess after only hrs basement etc i visually projected that if i had myself been in the place of my dad at this moment i would have been absolutely terrified of finding his corpse it makes me sick to my stomach anyway he ended up checking the last room my auntuncles his parentss bedroom fully expecting to find nothing and just my cousin gone god knows where thats kind of a big no no in my family going into someones bedroom like checking into someone elses underwear drawer crossing the bounds of intimacy kinda he actually was in his parents bed my dad had to shake him not just a little to finally make him wake up keep in mind that he had already been screaming his name in the whole house for like a good mins prior my dad is sure that he was hangover his parents cancelled their plans and drove back to throw him out today about him leaving the medical institution he told his exwife it was because of a physical fight that occurred told his parents something else i assume due to shame and the center just wont tell us because he will let you know himself what happened except it seems he fcking wont and even if he did im not even sure we can still take things at face value i cant be mad at him i cant scream at him i dont hate him i just feel so fcking bad for him i dont think i can do anything to help him and even if i knew what to do im not sure i could bc i dont have the mental space for all this myself i feel like im already drowning in my own mental shit i cant charge my overflowing shit cart with his shit as well basically it feels like family and i have been waiting for him to hit rock bottom to finally start getting better but from what i can tell from where i stand it seem like hes stuck at said rock bottom and not coming back up anytime soon family members his parents ex wife etc are just absolutely exhausted and pissed off after what it seem a years of constant horrible struggle seems like nobody will help him anymore now his parents have now tossed him out again not the first time im told and have asked usme to not give him any money im fucking terrified at the idea of him becoming a hobo or worse dying in a ditch from substance abuse or unaliving himself he has never expressed anything about self harm but my mind is running for the worst ive been raised by my parents to not turn my back anyone and be a compassionate human being and all that goodie two shoes sht but now im asked to abandon a family member and im actually starting myself to think thats indeed what i should do instead of basically paying for drugs it goes against everything ive been taught and feels disgusting dismissive hypocritical telling myself stuff like i have to stop helping him its for his own good im afraid hes gon na de if i stop giving money but if i keep giving money he might de from substance abuse or keep slowly decaying im struggling to be accountable form my own life and it feels like im now somewhat responsible for someone else so yeah what should i do edit sorry it seems i did not in fact managed to keep things as short as possible,2,7

grades school started decline focused energy towards gon na get high next gon na get money could say get money even questioning grandparents xanax finally decide good idea go lie grandparents house say use restroom instead using restroom searched medicine cupboard found sorts goodies oxy hydro ativan even xanax first nervous take opioids heard addictive never take course rationalized head make ok decided take mg oxycodene night truly night everything began crumble absolutely love drug wanted nothing except ended rest wasnt much one dose drug began tear even parents cupboards hope would find would even lie friends needing use restroom forgetting something order see anything cupboards could take satisfy awhile stopped searching mostly searched everywhere weed day everyday started college fall nothing piss poor performance motivation gpa seeing smoking weed day everyday academic success got super depressed anxious college found alcohol alcohol would make feel good wouldnt anxious anymore started drink every opportunity could would drink much could smoke much could order fill empty hole inside point time began see therapist psychiatrist try help depression anxiety give antidepressants adderall adhd said oh boy ive never done adderall lets try began daily dose one pill quickly devolved using entire bottle week less seems like care motivated drugs one drug kind psychoactive substance would make sober still struggling college probably fail parents dont know continued drug use lie grades good feel terrible lying always easier explaining situation im get feeling bad lying grades bad always turn closest substance comfort help relaxing want get sober stop drugs dont know im really lost really scared im going path addiction advice appreciated thank reading far means lot tldr smoked weed first time junior highschool lead degenerate drug filled life hate,im scared for addiction it all started when a girl i randomly met at some sport event i dont exactly remember offered me a weed dab i was hesitant at first because i hadnt even been drunk up to this point but i thought she was cute and i didnt want to seem lame i took the dab that she gave me and i was on planet mars i had never felt that good in my entire life i went on for a couple months without ever smoking weed again or really even thinking about smoking weed it was summer time and i was going into my senior year of highschool and was wanting to go out and party because i thought it sounded fun at the time i eventually made friends with people who threw parties and i obviously decided to go it was at this party that i was exposed to weed again the last time i smoked weed or did any substance was months earlier and i had a blast so i decided to do it again and drink some alcohol i ended up finding someone who would sell to me and i had a few extra dollars laying around so i decided to buy some wax of off them i fell in love with weed it was all that i wanted to do it started off with every month or so so not too big of an expense eventually i began to grow a tolerance to weed and just ended up buying even more rather than taking a tbreak i was out smoking one day in my car and i had an idea my grandfather has a bottle of xanax in his bathroom cupboard and hes not home right now i have no idea why i had that thought in my head or why i actually decided to go and take some this stuff hit wayyyyyy harder than weed ever could and i loved it a week went by but the whole time i was thinking about how good the xanax felt my grades in school started to decline and i focused most of my energy towards where i was gon na get high next how i was gon na get the money what could i say to get the money even questioning if my grandparents had more of that xanax i finally decide that its a good idea to go and lie to my grandparents while i was at there house and say that i had to use the restroom instead of using the restroom i searched through their medicine cupboard and found all sorts of goodies oxy hydro ativan and even more xanax at first i was nervous to take the opioids because i have heard how addictive they are and to never take them once of course i rationalized it in my head to make it ok decided to take mg of oxycodene that night that was truly the night where everything began to crumble i was absolutely in love with the drug and wanted nothing except more i ended up doing the rest of what i had it wasnt much about one more dose of each drug after i was out i began to tear through even my own parents cupboards for the hope that i would find some more i would even lie to my own friends about needing to use the restroom or forgetting something in order to see if there was anything in there cupboards that i could take to satisfy me after awhile i stopped searching mostly because i have searched everywhere i can and just did weed all day everyday i started college this fall and it has been nothing but piss poor performance motivation and gpa after seeing what smoking weed all day everyday did to my academic success i got super depressed and anxious it was in college that i found alcohol alcohol would make me feel good and i wouldnt be anxious anymore i started to drink at every opportunity i could i would drink as much as i could and smoke as much as i could in order to fill that empty hole inside of me at this point in time i began to see a therapist and psychiatrist to try and help with my depression and anxiety but all they did was give me antidepressants and adderall for my adhd they said i had oh boy ive never done adderall before lets try it it began with just my daily dose of one pill but quickly devolved into using the entire bottle in a week or less it seems like all i care about or am motivated for is drugs not one drug but any kind of psychoactive substance that would make me not sober i am still struggling in college and will probably fail out my parents dont know about my continued drug use and i lie to them about my grades being good i feel terrible lying to them but i always do it because its easier than explaining the situation im in when i get to feeling bad about lying to them or my grades being bad i always turn to the closest substance for comfort and help relaxing i want to get sober and stop doing drugs but i just dont know how im really lost and really scared that im going down the path of addiction any advice is appreciated thank you for reading this far it means a lot to me tldr i smoked weed for the first time as a junior in highschool and it has lead me down a degenerate drug filled life that i hate,0,1

consistency for my neuropathways to turn from a highway of hell to a deer trail i kicked the shit the drink the smoke everything completed months of inoutpatient treatment lived in sober housing attended meetings everyday involved with sober community as much as i can i made it to months of honest sobriety then i smoked a cig personal choice to classify it as an abused substance then bought a pack then took a psilocybin gummy then took it every other day then i thought one beer wouldnt hurt it didnt hurt but making that choice it loosened a discipline screw as if to say promises that i make for myself dont matter then i hit a dab pen then i made a routine of enjoying tall boys each night while in a sober house in my room the dopamine created an illusion of a grand ol time instant stress reliever too lazy then i got a job at a bougie bar because the tips are great first job of my sober lifestyle at this point i still havent changed my original sobriety date mind you even though i was spiraling my life was extremely productive full time student gym times a week volunteering pursuing passions acting modeling art never had so many healthy relationships in my life so l i started getting some money under my belt and decided to move out of sober living with a buddy of mine from rehab who had relapsed already the day that i packed the uhaul van and drove it off the driveway for the last time i immediately asked my buddy to get an ball we got fucked up i didnt sleep for days was stuck in a loop of satisfying the wildfire of my serial urges tinder porn massage parlors at the beginning of the comedown i realized that all of those missions and quests which i had been on the past days to satisfy my urges were pointless paranoia fear feeling of impending doom had set in and everything beneath the surface of my skin was trapped in a purgatory hell literally it was a dejavu because for years i was a meth addict with a fetish for sleep deprived and drug induced psychosis i found myself being overcome by the same emotional paralysis and absolute devastation which had been the catalyst to get sober in the first place after eventually sleeping for days i woke up doom was gone i was well rested somewhat sun was shining squirrels were hurrying nuts everything was back to normal the relief was immense i knew i had fucked up and now i needed to correct the course after all i am aware of all the truthful clichs in aa and knew that there was a way back to redemption over the next month i found myself slowly sinking tallboy turned into a sixpack sixpack into a twelver and twelver into another twelver all within a hour period secrets shame guilt anger sadness started to pile up within as i held on to denial with honor and even some sort of awareness it turned into a me against the world i became a stranger and people became stranger although i held on to some principles ive learned and made sure to maintain my responsibilities as to not prove correct the often mentioned phrase thanks to addiction i lost everything in my life paraphrasing by the end of december all i did was study work drink and fuck my new gf whom i declared my loyalty and absolutely love to in a state of a drunken euphoria and made sure to be really convincing for the sake or personal comfort she wasis in the program too struggling i might add i made her look like frigging bill himself i became desperate and depressed as fuck destructive angry an opportunity came along to go abroad and live with my family for the winter quarter it was perfect because i needed a hard reset bought a one way ticket and got a sense of relief im not as hopeless and stuck as i thought anyway let me go grab a pack before the store closes you know what lets make it and tallboys i never made it to my flight the next day i woke up days later on my floor by myself having suffered at least one seizure im epileptic and can recognize post seizure symptoms phone had missed calls from my family because i never arrived there and noone could reach me it was surreal i didnt know what was going on absolutely fried made it on a plane the next day finally the light at the end of the tunnel surely being on a different continent will allow me to reset get my shit straight drop the habits again and focus well even though it has been a spiritual experience like i intended the abuse technically got worse since being here for months ive begun to use meth again drinking like an elephant engaging in risky behavior sexual and otherwise so as i sit here right now on day of no sleep smelling like coconut oil lube and burnt meth trying to control the circumference of my eyeballs so that i dont look like a crazy person wondering how my favorite pornstar of the day is holding up without my intense supervision of her performance as i type this while plotting on ways that i can inspire or win over an escort to give me a session on the house or what specific series of words i need to use to convince a woman on tinder to be my personal pornstar for the night orah you get the gist i am genuinely beyond scared just like a front line soldier who is numb to the chaos and atrocities because i am gaslighting myself about the fact that i have a serious issue meth isnt the same thing as eating a kitkat on your cheatday from the gym i cant just run it off and be scot free from circumstances especially with my epilepsy i need help but i dont feel desperate enough to admit the seriousness of whats going on with me im so fucking depressed so much on my mind i have to get it off my chest what would my granny say if she saw me snorting death god grant me the serenity to accept the things i can not change courage to change the things i can and the wisdom to know the difference god thank you for blessing me with another day on this beautiful planet and with a will to fight even though it is a dark time right now it is happening for a reason it has to be show me the way allow me to be the light amongst darkness place me where you need me to be thank you for allowing me to vent with much love appreciation and gratitude yours truly a,7,7

time thank taking step back move forward im scares stepping back coaching social media least month focus healing love work hate pause understand way isnt always right way necessary chapter story time take step back truly move forward,my daily battles and journey to freedom depression and anxiety i have suffered from depression since childhood fighting a relentless battle with low mood selfharm panic attacks and suicidal thoughts well into adulthood eventually the pain became unbearable one morning in april last year i attempted to take my own life i am so grateful i survived but despite many positive behavioral changes prescribed medication nhs and private therapy my depression remains unresolved i have been hospitalized twice to protect myself yet i have never truly known a life without mental illness addiction the only thing i have found harder to ballte than depression is addiction from a young age i desperately latched onto anything that could change the way i felt as a teenager i experimented with substancesoriginally out of curiosity not all the side effects were fun but that never stopped me from using them again that was the first warning sign what started as occasional use slowly became a daily necessity without even realizing it i reached a point where i was using up to six different substances every single dayjust to function by then i was far from a teenager but miles away from the man i wanted to be the delusion of the addict the power of spirituality and surrender for years i told myself i had it under control because i was highfunctioning i believed i would grow out of it but the truth is i lost all power of control over alcohol and drugs recovery and hope from depression and addiction the best thing i have ever done is admit that my life had become unmanageable and that i could no longer do it alone since mid i have been regularly attending aa and na meetings often going to one every day i have committed to regular meetings and working the steps with my sponsor making recovery my top priority has helped me in ways i never imagined and i am incredibly grateful for these free services ive had months of sobriety that once felt impossible but for an addict knowing about your addiction and wanting to stop is not a cure relapse has been a painful reality of my journey each time ive had to surrender to things outside of my control and make brave changes to the things i can control there is no cure for addiction but i know that if i follow spiritual principlesone day at a timethen i will remain free i have also worked incredibly hard to battle my mental health struggles to me they are deeply linked but they can also exist on their own last weekend i was in a very bad place i voluntarily went to manchester royal to section myself to protect myself only to be denied because i was honest about my history of substance use addiction and depression are deeply connected each deserves to be recognized and treated equally i have had to jump through countless hoops just to receive the same mental health support that i believe everyone should be entitled to a system that creates barriers to care does not encourage compassion or recognize the equal value of all lives support from my people for long periods of my life i have struggled to show myself love or compassion but so many people have shown me kindnessmore than i ever believed i deserved some of the best advice and efforts from those who cared didnt always work it may have seemed like i didnt want to listen but that wasnt the case its incredibly difficult to act on logical advice when youre trapped in an illogical mental state however their care and persistence showed me that i was lovedand that made a difference my survival instinct kept me going for a long time but surviving isnt the same as living the most sincere and organic happiness i have ever felt is from love i am so grateful for the love i have received in my life i appreciate that this may be a difficult read for many i havent sugarcoated my story mental illness and addiction are painful and that pain doesnt just affect the sufferer my family sarah my great friend and flatmate ethan those friends i hold so dearly my colleagues and so many others have all felt that suffering alongside me i am eternally grateful to those who have shown up for me in any form at any time thank you taking a step back to move forward so im doing what scares me i am stepping back from coaching and social media for at least a month to focus on healing i love my work and i hate to pause but i now understand that my way isnt always the right way this is a necessary chapter in my story its time to take that step back to truly move forward,2,1

one way street really trying work want get past craziness us feel love dont know im simply broken right man sweetest person hes sober sometimes dick cant really end get,terrified for the future this is my first ever reddit post and i literally am just doing this because i truly dont know how to get through the night i lay here at pm on my moms couch holding my newborn baby so he can rest before i have to wake up at am for work tomorrow after i called in today i just dont see myself getting any real rest tonight as my mind is going a million different directions my boyfriend got arrested last night for domestic assault and resisting arrest and im scared for him and us and what the future holds let me preface by saying that him and have been together a little over a year ago officially and were talking about months prior to that on and off we both struggled with substance abuse mine being alcohol and his being mth well we just had a baby weeks ago and i was sober for the pregnancy outside of a slip up early on in the pregnancy when i was considering an abortion that i still feel terrible about to this day he was sober most of my pregnancy but had a few slip ups that made my life hell at the time but i know how it feels to have an addiction so we got through it each time well weeks postpartum i was doing really unwell suffering very bad from postpartum depression anxiety rage and ptsd after i had my traumatic emergency c section he made a mistake and got high and that along with the sleep deprivation and postpartum depression led me to drink so we were both just a mess baby went to grandmas while this was happening anyways when he does drugs he tends to look at other women a lot on his phone and watches porn obsessively etc that makes me just lose my mind especially with my body feeling like a deflated balloon postbirth anyways we got through that but the last weeks ive just been standoffish and upset because all i can replay in my head is the other women he was looking at even though its only something he does under the influence but also trying to keep the peace with him he has apologized numerous times but its just something that i told him im going to need time to get over and he seemed like that was okay well friday night after he got off work he came home and wanted to have a conversation about it and why ive been so different and it just kinda escalated but not into anything serious we just went to sleep and the night was done i had sensed that maybe he was high but didnt know for sure the next morning things were tense but not that bad until we got into it again so i packed my bags and my baby and went to my moms but i didnt feel right where we left things off so i went back to talk to him alone and admittedly did drink a bit before i went over things escalated again so cops called i went to stay at a friends for the night and came back home last night and things just escalated again because i was under the influence and so was he cops were called by me and neighbors and he was ended up arrested for domestic assault and resisting even though i didnt want to press any charges so he went to jail that night and was on a hour hold but the state wanted to press charges so hes still in there and here i am worried sick about him when hes sober he truly is an amazing man but the drug addiction turns him into a monster how can we get through this and past this how can i support him in getting sober and keeping myself sober is this truly something we can get through if we both want it bad enough i dont even know where he stands at this point all i can think about is just him being in a jail cell alone detoxing from drugs not knowing anything going on my heart is breaking even after everything i just want him back home with me and our baby sober happy and healthy i havent been able to talk to him and im just so worried maybe he hates me now but im also praying maybe this is the wake up call for him to actually get sober thoughts i know that was a lot and probably all over the place i just cant sleep and have been sick all day thinking about all of this scared praying i was ready to come and pick him up after the hour hold but just the fact that i have to keep waiting longer until he goes to court in the next couple days breaks my heart ive been violent in the past towards him too so its not just the one way street but i was really trying to work on it i just want him and i to get past this craziness and for us all to feel the love again i dont know im just simply broken right now this man is the sweetest person when hes sober sometimes he can be a dick but cant we all does this all really have to be the end or can we get through this and how,1,1

help and remind me of what i need to do just having the perspective and written down rules has helped me you have to want to quit all the selfhelp books and all the support groups in the world are not going to help you if you dont actually want to quit find a reason to quit any reason outside of yourself that can make you accountable start small and build from there responsibility can be a hell of a driving force when its something you care about redirect the the urge to something beneficial as an addict i have the superhuman ability to pour all of myself into something that gives me joy replacing the bad behaviors with something improves your current situation can help while keeping you busy never get bored im a machine of habit when i get bored i get back into whatever habit thats easiest for me building new habits takes time dont give up if needed remove the people and things that allow you to continue the addiction this one sucks it hurts to lose someone that was close to you but when the people around you arent helping you or in some cases actively hurting you then you need to think about what you really need to do and sometimes that means cutting people out this goes for physical locations and inanimate objects as well find anything that works for you what works for you may not help someone else what works for me might seem alien and totally unreasonable to somebody else but as long as it keeps me clean then thats what i need to do get help if you need it you dont have to do this alone if you feel yourself falter or begin to fail there are thousands of people that know how to help and might even know exactly what you are going through you just have to look it doesnt all have to be the perfect you can still be a mess and be sober everyday sober is better even if you arent the best at least you know youre trying i had to invoke my fifth rule this last year i quit my job without going into the nitty gritty of it all i worked at a smaller business of about people total and to put it mildly they were not sober i loved that job i liked the guys i worked with but it became clear to me that they were not healthy for me to be around one of them may even have been dealing needless to say as soon as i found out the extent of the substance abuse going on behind the scenes i left the next day it all turned out for the better i got a new job with less toxic people and im much happier here than the four years i was at my other job it can be rough sometimes it may even seem impossible but you will still be better without the people that destroy you and simply do not care about you from my experience narcissistic and addictive behaviors tend to come together in the more extreme cases of abuse and you may not even be aware of it until after youve removed them from your life it is important to take stock of the things around you and regularly check if its healthy and helpful otherwise you get stuck in your patterns again and it is so damn hard to get out of them sorry for the word vomit but i think it was important for me to at least talk about using my own advice you are all awesome you can do this never get bored and never stop good

parents house start living alone scares shit understand life go like therapy helps lot want change learn life life content stability addictive dopamine oxytocin love bombings change start loving okay,love relationship addiction advice struggle to be alone hi everyone m here i want to get some advice regarding love relationship addiction and how to learn to live a content life without a partner i struggle with living alone my life seems to be a bit bleak boring and even unsatisfying if i dont have a romantic interest to pursue build future with i also have this toxic belief that people who dont have families partners are not okay i understand how dangerous it is to have such beliefs and thats why i am here seeking advice on how to break free background as a kid i was loved by my parents a lot i have a classic combo of a very loving mother and more distant father who couldnt express his emotions as much my grandparents who were alive as of my childhood also cared about me a lot so i cant say that i wasnt loved enough there was a period of my childhood which inflicted an abandonment wound on me when i was and my grandpa and then my grandma died because my parents had to go to work they would sometimes leave me alone this time alone was a pure hell for me i literally had panic attacks i wouldnt play or have fun i would just run around the flat scream cry open the door and sob into the darkness dad are you there because im from a postsoviet country of course no one consulted a therapist this period lasted for some time until one day we were at our friends place and i decided to stay there by myself for some time because i had a lot of fun playing a video game that evening broke my pattern of being scared still at that time it was somewhat hard to be alone and this discomfort of being alone dragged itself into my teen life when i was i met a girl online and fell for her i remember once before going to bed i fantasized about us walking together i felt so good that since that moment of my sleep fantasies are about me cuddling with someone that period of time was also very difficult for me as a teen so now i think i used those fantasies to escape reality and find some comfort it was a survival strategy of some kind since that time and until now i dont think i have ever spent more than months without someone to obsess over i have always felt that being alone was dull and needed a romantic interest to give my life spark and meaning this caused me to develop a bunch of toxic beliefs about being alone and placed partners family and kids on a huge pedestal i found myself in a situation when doing my favorite hobby without having someone in the background felt like but with someone it would jump to i would literally get high from knowing that there is someone out there waiting for me i became addicted of course i am an anxious attacher if you need this info in a relationship i am the one constantly being afraid of losing a partner which leads to me losing my boundaries and becoming dependent on them i am about to finally move out of my parents house and start living alone which scares the shit out of me i understand that life can not go on like this i am in therapy and it helps a lot i want to change to learn how to life my life and how to be content with stability and not addictive dopamine oxytocin love bombings how do i change that how do i start loving myself and being okay with just being by myself,1,1

addiction just a lot more of a personal version i wrote just for myself and her to look at that a few people asked me to share view my profile if youd like to see it i met the love of my life when i was we met online actually in an instrumental karaoke discord i would play piano in an empty channel to myself for a couple hours a day maybe have somebody join for seconds and leave without saying anything one day i saw somebody sitting alone in their own channel and decided to jump in she was playing ukulele over the rainbow of course i thought it was so insanely cheesy but i stayed through all of it and said your play well thank you they then left the channel a couple days later i was doing my thing alone and the same person jumps into my channel insteadand we didnt stop talking for a single waking moment for years for the entire time i knew this woman she was the light of my life my purpose for existing i was suicidal before i met her i was probably in those empty chat rooms hoping to just find some sort of help somebody to listen but instead i found the love of my life and i betrayed her i was on pain killers from the ages of to i was in a bad accident as a kid and my doctor thought it was necessary then but then the opiate crisis started and without warning they switched me to a bunch of different muscle relaxers anti inflammatory stuff you name it everything except pain killers yrs old it was really hard for a good year my then girlfriend was really busy going through nursing school and i was able to hide how much i was hurting quite a lot i dont think she ever expected anything was wrong to be honest not to blame her at all i hid the aches and pains and sweats in the beginning and after the withdrawals left i just had to hide the pain i probably popped ibuprofen a day back then years old i had the best time of my life with my partner for so many years dozens of vacations and dinners and movies and countless upon countless nights spent up until in the morning just because we didnt want to fall asleep and end our time together and then i went to a routine doctor check up i was working a new job at the time on my feet hours a day constant lifting the pain was bad i told the doctor that he gave me the same yada yada as always about inflammation and exercise and stretchingbut at the end he mentioned something kratom some all natural plant that had healing properties i disregarded him hippy type doctor always telling me the cure to life is some plant or to stop eating msg jump forward a few months and i had to find a new job last one just wasnt working out one day a few weeks in im taking out the trash and a neighbor a couple stores down tells me to come over and try their stuff its awesome blah blah blah he mentioned that same name as my doctor kratomi gave in and went over one day and they made me this awful nasty clumpy orange juice and green powder that refuses to mix with the liquid death soup shot half an hour later i was astonished same exact feeling as the pain relievers i was on years ago years old im living in texas now with the best job ive ever had potential to make over k a year with bonuses with the best girl in the world with prospects of having children and buying a home together ive won over her mom her dad her grandparents the whole family treats me like a sonbut in the backgroundim wasting hundreds of dollars a week buying hydroxiea souped up super addictive version of kratom my life is falling apart im falling behind on bills to feed my addiction i dont buy the love of my life a single christmas present because im so behind on bills from wasting so much moneyi owe on my car a couple weeks later i got arrested for failing to stop and provide my insurance when i bumped an empty parked car in a loti didnt notice any damage and just drove offit was stupid and i payed the ultimate price for itlater that night when i finally was able to call hershe was distraught totally inconsolable telling me that shes going to kill herself for what ive doneshe got into my car to move it and found my dozens of bottlesmy stash of everythingthe price tags were on the thingsshe told me just what was in the car was worth almost this was weeks after christmas she ended up bailing me out of jail picking me up taking me homeand she sat down with me and told me she was in it with me she was going to help me through this addiction she wouldnt abandon me in my time of need she came up coping methods to try and help me stay distracted from all of that bad stuff encouraged my hobbies she helped with everything i was clean for less than a week before we had a fight late in the nightshe had told me that this was so difficult she had wished she never found out she just wanted a normal beautiful life like we used to have i encouraged her to slap me to wake me up and that i was going to try so hard to give her everything in the worldbut after she went to bed i couldnt sleep i paced for hours back and forthall i could hear in my head was her cryingtelling me how hard i made this on usall i could think to myself was im not good enough for herso what does it matter anywaysso i took her credit card and went and bought more drugs then i raced home and pretended everything was normali took one and my brain was quiet for the first time since i felt her hand on my face later that day she was out with her mom and i got a callshe knew everything she saw the bank charge she saw me leave on our ring cam she saw footage of me in the shop buying the drugs the addiction she would help me through but this was like the rd or th time that i stole from her as well and she put it together that the times in the past were me as welli never begged for another chance so hard in my whole lifei was out in the streets living out of my car lost my joba week later a semi truck tboned me and my car was impounded truly homeless at this point another homeless person steals my bags of clothes food and blanket a couple days later im back in colorado nowive been clean since the last moment i saw her over or days i wana sayi tried to kill myself last nightshe had called me out of the blueand i had been planning to do it soon anyways so i figuredif i can die listening to her voice that would be pretty goodi swallowed bottles of sleeping pills i had saved up over the last couple weeks while she was talkingshe caught on when my words started to slurr and i told her what i didat first i tried to hide from the cops she sent but hearing her wailing and crying was too much for me to take i waved

medicine it was quite a lot i dont think she ever expected anything was wrong to be honest not to blame her at all i hid the aches and pains and sweats in the beginning and after the withdrawals left i just had to hide the pain i probably popped ibuprofen a day back then i spent truly countless nights staying up with my partner until to am with her just to be supportive with her stufies and stress a lot of the time i wouldnt even fall asleep because i wanted to be awake the second she woke up i didnt want to miss even one single possible second of interaction with her to these years had challenges i had to overcome some incredibly traumatic family drama she supported me through every moment of it i might have died were it not for her i was looking for jobs in a dead end town living paycheck to paycheck deciding between buying some extra soup and saving bucks for the week we had some trust issue problems around this time as well whenever she would get mad at me for anything i took her very very seriously but i always laughed in the back of my head because i knew whatever worry she might have was totally irrelevant to me as a man who existed for her and her alone i had issues too but she always calmed me down reminding me who she is we went on vacations sometimes twice a year but always once a year at least texas texas again texas againwe like texas denver steamboat springs grand junction we made so many amazing memories we were living like we wanted to live the rest of our lives before i ruined everything yrs old i had the best time of my life with my partner

love of my life a single christmas present because im so behind on bills from wasting so much moneyi owe on my cari used her money to feed my habit when im truly broke a couple weeks later i got arrested for failing to stop and provide my insurance when i bumped an empty parked car in a loti didnt notice any damage and just drove offit was stupid and i payed the ultimate price for it they found me instantlylater that night when i finally was able to call her from the jailshe was distraught totally inconsolable telling me that shes going to kill herself for what ive doneshe got into my car to move it and found my dozens of bottlesmy stash of everythingthe price tags were on the thingsshe could imagine how much money was wastedthis was weeks after christmas she ended up bailing me out of jail picking me up taking me homeand she sat down with me and told me she was in it with me she was going to help me through this addiction she wouldnt abandon me in my time of need she came up with coping methods to try and help me stay distracted from all of that bad stuff encouraged my hobbies she helped with everything i was clean for less than a week before we had a fight late in the nightshe had told me that this was so difficult she had wished she never found out she just wanted a normal beautiful life like we used to have i encouraged her to slap me to wake me up and that i was going to try so hard to give her everything in the worldbut after she went to bed i couldnt sleep i paced for hours back and forthall i could hear in my head was her cryingtelling me how hard i made this on usall i could think to myself was im not good enough for herso what does it matter anywaysthe pain the voice is louder than ever beforei took her credit card and went and bought more then i raced home and pretended everything was normali took one and my brain was quiet for the first time since i felt her hand on my facethe voice didnt come back this time a little later that day she was out with her mom and i got a callshe knew everything she saw the bank charge she saw me leave on our ring cam she saw footage of me in the shop buying the drugs the addiction she would help me through but this was like the rd or th time that i stole from her as well and she put it together that the times in the past were me as welli never begged for another chance so hard in my whole lifei was out in the streets living out of my car lost my joba week later a semi truck tboned me and my car was impounded truly homeless at this point another homeless person steals my bags of clothes food and blanket a couple days later im back in colorado nowive been clean since the last moment i saw her over or days i wana sayi tried to kill myself last nightshe had called me out of the bluetold me some things that shattered me into pieces the same way i did to her justdifferent methods i told her that i love her anyways i would love her if she murdered someone i would love her even if she did the and only thing i told her in the past would ever make me leaveeven if she did it times i didnt carei had a devil in me taking over my body making me do evil things i hurt her just as badlyi truly love her more than i could ever love myselfbut if this is the last time we might talkwell i had been planning to do it soon anyways so i figuredif i can die listening to her voice that would be pretty goodi swallowed bottles of sleeping pills i had saved up over the last couple weeks while she was talkingshe caught on when my words started to slurr and i told her what i didat first i tried to hide from the cops she sent but hearing her wailing and crying was too much for me to take i waved over a cop and just remember puking my guts out i really dont know what to do now we were each others firsts lovesfirst everythingshug kiss date valentines vacationand for me shell always be my last wether i end up living another days or years she will be the last woman i ever touch love think about

long story yes involves alcoholism huge part mental health problems pressuring bc mother want know know personal experience someone state truly discuss happeningthat better leave alone moment pry time place trying get open wait come sit anxiety deal thru mental health team bc momsand humans empathy sympathy free skills learn people deal let deal time come relationship continue support question best know nothing cocaine except powder take iv smoke know little effects tbh know know lots ketamine abuse anything bc elon musk sad want know say say deals thisboth breakup drug use relatedand separate problems time looking rehabs capable catch falls isnt person abuse issues going years im hoping strong enough overcome mama support bc know hard kick something like drug alcohol like support husband gave support struggling drinking took getting drunk passing public restaurant snap right whatever stupidity embroiled time hard decision took months able start abandonment alcohol friend since since year officially quit september yes weird date know fed fat tired sicklyso done thanks help guys empathize dont want make excuses anything isnt keeping positive proactive attitude hope yall well,support for my son ok i am a recovering alcoholic which makes this quite painful and relatable at the same time my yr old son just admitted to me that he and his wife they are both trans and just got married had been doing cocaine for a while and were having a lot of problems bc of it but that they were trying to work it out that was a couple weeks ago i woke up yesterday to my son ranting on fb about how did this happen and about his heart being brokenyou get the point i texted him immediately and he didnt want to talk about it he just told me they had split up and that he didnt know where it would go from here he talked about not hurting her like papa had hurt me but then it has fallen apart for them anyhow as far as i can tell from the little he has shared since then they are working on it but they both keep posting memes and old pics of each other together and happy all over fbit absolutely kills me inside bc i dont know how he is feeling and i dont want my first born to go thru another heartache jesus he is and he has had enough heartache and stress in his life already long story and yes it involves my alcoholism as a huge part of why he has mental health problems now i am not pressuring him bc as a mother i want to know but i know from personal experience that if someone is in a state where they truly can not discuss what is happeningthat it is better to leave it alone for the moment than to pry there is a time and place for trying to get him to open up to me but it is not now i will wait for him to come to me and i will sit with my anxiety and deal with it myself and thru my own mental health team bc that is what we do as momsand should do as humans empathy and sympathy are free skills to learn people i will deal with it and let him deal with it and when its time he will come to me that is our relationship i will continue to support him so my question is how best can i do that i know nothing about cocaine at all except its a powder or you can take it by iv or you can smoke it i know little about its effects tbh i know know lots more about ketamine abuse than anything bc of elon musk how sad is that i just want to know what to say and not to say as he deals with thisboth his breakup and the drug use which are relatedand separate problems at the same time he is looking into rehabs and all he is more than capable but i am here to catch him if he falls he isnt a person who has abuse issues that have been going on for years so im hoping that he is strong enough to overcome mama is there for support bc i know how hard it is to kick something like a drug alcohol and what its like to not have support for that my husband gave me no support as i was struggling with drinking it took getting so drunk and passing out at a public restaurant to snap me right out of whatever stupidity i was embroiled in at the time it was a hard decision and it took months to be able to start my abandonment of alcohol it had been my friend since i was so since the year and i officially quit on september yes weird date i know but i was just fed up with being fat and tired and sicklyso i was done thanks for your help guys i empathize but i dont want to make excuses for him or anything he isnt doing that and he is keeping a positive and proactive attitude about it i hope yall are well,1,1

effects something quantify late also something people talk lot always liver kidney stomach mother mental health social worker years number patients young early alcoholinduced dementia shocking always warned didnt listenbecause born addict anything parents dna mentioned paragraphs ago sexual physical trauma experienced child destined battle trauma alcohol mate im saying alcohol outlawed tried didnt work well casual approach take alcohol society killing many people cigarettes gross get still like heater twoaddict read mind alcohol insidious deceitful destructive substance planet outside maybe opiates general hope younger folks reading think twice get habituated boozing every weekend college whateveror thinking ok cos legal first thats selfmedication talk seek therapy dont wait youre trust us old folks end story sorts worked restaurant guy would buy sixpack killians irish red beeri drank six pack night months endloved made feel stopped acknowledged might problem didnt drink alcohol nearly yearsuntil st birthday downhill ever since youre new feel like might problem controlling drinking stop dont let get beg trust believe,general thoughts on my years of heavy drinking ive m been drinking on average a pint of distilled alcohol vodka or whiskey days a week for almost years i was a heavy binge drinker for years before that but i at least took time off here and there when bingingive always drank a lot of water for what thats worth you should be doing that regardless shockingly i have thus far only experienced relatively minor digestive inflammation issues and some slightly elevated liver enzyme levels that dropped significantly when i took a month off and changed my diet in other words for whatever reason my genes have thus far seemingly protected me from major physical damage but my marriage failed she drank a lot too as did the next relationship i was in she drank a lot too seeing a pattern i havent pursued interests or career with the vigor i should have ive let my house go to shit neglected things that needed attention because i thought id have a drink or two and then take on that projectnah just drink more that being said the slow and steady weight gain the acid reflux that im beginning to experience my bloated faceall that asideim tired i sleep like shit most of the time im tired of being subservient to a substance im tired of wasting my money on something that makes me feel good for an hour and then i have to keep doing it to not feel like shit not to mention all of this could just catch up to me at some point just because im relatively ok now doesnt mean a few years from now i will be ok and the long term mental effects are not something you can quantify until its too late also not something people talk about a lot its always just liver kidney stomach my mother was a mental health social worker for years and the number of patients some as young as early s who had alcoholinduced dementia was shocking to her she always warned me and i didnt listenbecause i was born an addict not because of anything my parents did it was in that same dna i just mentioned a few paragraphs ago and in the sexual and physical trauma i experienced as a child i was destined for this battle against trauma and alcohol was my mate im not saying alcohol should be outlawed we tried that didnt work very well but the casual approach we take to alcohol as a society is killing so many people cigarettes are gross we all get that now i still like having a heater or twoaddict did you read above but in my mind alcohol is the most insidious deceitful and destructive substance on the planet outside of maybe opiates in general my hope here is that any younger folks reading this will think twice before they get habituated to boozing every weekend at college or whateveror thinking its ok cos its legal first of all thats selfmedication talk seek out therapy now dont wait until youre trust us old folks i will end this with a story of sorts when i was i worked in a restaurant there was a guy who would buy be a sixpack of killians irish red beeri drank a six pack a night for months on endloved how it made me feel but i stopped myself at and acknowledged that i might have a problem i didnt drink alcohol for nearly yearsuntil my st birthday its been downhill ever since if youre new to this and feel like you might have a problem controlling your drinking stop now dont let yourself get to where we are i beg you trust me believe me,50,9

people hide drinking well oblivious guess im really looking much answers answers want know really let could done anything different known thanks listening,how did i miss it could i have done anything different hi there im not sure if this is the right subreddit but i just want to get this off my chest my best friend for over a decade died of alcoholism about a year and a half ago she was years old and while i have a lot of peace now there is still so much i struggle with surrounding her death just for clarity liver failure due alcoholism is whats listed on her death certificate so its not like an ambiguous thing her drinking is what killed her however thats also the part that i struggle most with i had no idea not even the slightest clue that she was struggling with alcohol we met as freshmen at college so drinking did play a decent role in our relationship but i wouldnt say we drank any more excessively than our peers obviously she was drinking alot more than i knew about and probably for a lot longer still it makes me question so much of our time together we did drink and go out but it all seemed normal in the context of college we also lived together for years even sharing a room our senior year still i had no clue that she might be drinking excessively after we graduated we moved and grew a bit apart we were still close but caught up in our daily lives however as the years went on i saw her become less and less happy i was really worried for her but also felt like i couldnt help her if she didnt want to help herself again i was completely oblivious to the drinking i just thought she was depressed and i didnt know how to be there for for her other than to be her friend and keep showing her i cared there was a tipping point tho id gone to visit her and was really shocked at the way she and her partner were living i knew she was not healthy a couple of months later she came to visit me and honestly the weekend left me feeling like i needed to distance myself from her to protect my own heart looking back i regret this so so much we stayed friendly as time went by texting regularly and calling each other occasionally in fact i had just had a quick conversation with her when a few days later her partner messaged me that she was in the hospital and unlikely to make it i was shocked especially when they told me it was due to liver failure because of her drinking she was unlikely to qualify for a transplant and ended up being too sick for one anyway she died weeks after being admitted later i helped her partner go through her stuff and there were remnants of alcohol everywhere little bottles of vodka hidden in her drawers and in cupboards a coffee cup in her car filled with vodka after a little looking around it became impossible to deny she really had been an alcoholic i was so furious with her partner for not noticing and letting things get so bad i was mad with myself for not knowing for all these years and for not being a better friend and i was and still sometimes am pissed at her for not confiding it was clear at the funeral that she had really isolated herself over the years and that makes me so sad i felt her push me away too and ultimately i let her i miss her dearly and there is so much i wish i could do differently in a lot of ways i feel like she committed suicide which i dont know if its fair to say i talk about her often but always freeze up when people ask how she died because it doesnt feel like my secret to share is it common for people to hide their drinking so well or were we just oblivious i guess im not really looking too much for answers because what answers are there i just want to know if i really did let her down could i have done anything different should i have known thanks for listening,4,9

fighting demon minute minute today even dont tell anyone know youre going someone else really arent alone seems thank anyone whose posts read gave courage thank,reading your experiences have helped me heres mine i joined this a few days ago when i started my sober journey again for what is now the th th maybe longer term go at it i started drinking heavily at my partner was at the time and i was all for the party what was late nights turned into early mornings then all day long binges then every day i would take shot to work in mini bottle hidden in my purse taking shots in the bathroom eating altoids all the time each and every time it will get bad enough ill skip out of my vodka and drink literally anything i can find if necessary i quit the first time after a visit to the er for vomiting blood and being told i needed subsequent visits to a specialist for the damage to my stomach and esophagus from throwing up so regularly they gave me meds and warned me id end up sicker than i knew what to do with it if i drank with them i didnt listen and laid on the bathroom floor puking for days and finally stopped after i physically couldnt hold it down any longer i was so sick i quit for over a year and relapsed again from one single mixed drink i really thought i could handle i quit again when i watched the hell my partner went through when we ended up too broke to buy more even with spare change i quit for almost months i cant even remember why i started again after that the third go round i tried down grading to wine then seltzer then finally my partner convinced me to go back to school the motivation and testing of nursing school kept me sober for almost a month then the stress set in from being a stay at home homeschooling mom to a five day a week full time student meant we started fighting i didnt have time to take on chores homeschool care for the pets and do school full time our relationship had been stressful since day with a child from another parent with severe disruptive behavioral issues and my partner was very very hesitant to ever address this so she ended up as quite the brat and even harder to handle by this time when i started leaving to go to school this accelerated as it reached its peak i was crying at school and frequently skipping classes staying home trying to handle it all and still holding down a part time job two days a week after class when i went school started in january and by early february i was drinking a few each night after the day was over then on february valentines day i left for school early and left a handwritten love note it was rejected not looked at and after a litany of texts lighting me up everything i wasnt doing amd how much of the misbehavior were me not the behavior i finished my exam left and went home to drink the whole bottle then i just didnt stop i left my partner during this period of heavy drinking nearly a month later with no announcement packed things when he was gone and left to be with someone who had been picking up the broken pieces with me at the part time job it was great for awhile i quit school changed jobs but still couldnt stop drinking eventually the new relationship failed too this time im sure because of my drinking i was volatile unpredictable and impossible to handle i was grieving my almost year relationship i left trying to start a new life and drinking enough to put a bear under the table four months later i left and went back to my previous partner i didnt know what else to do when i did try to quit i had withdraws quick my new partner had no concept of how bad this could get and would expect me to quit cold turkey even when the seizures started my old partner understood he picked me up and took me to get vodka i told myself it was to wean off but i didnt i stayed drunk everyday it seemed like the only way to deal with the emotional stress of a child who stole lied manipulated was violent and wouldnt listen no matter what sort of counseling or therapy was provided we were at our wits end then one morning at am an excruciating abdominal pain sent me to the er i assumed something was failing because of my drinking it was only a kidney stone but during my hour er stay with no alcohol i had to tell the doctor the truth as a foot lb woman i had been drinking around straight shots of vodka a day and it had been almost hours since my last the morphine they had been giving me was the only thing holding off more serious withdrawals they kept me three days sedated so much i barely remember it to detox i came home excited again to be sober to get back on things for things to be better it lasted months this time i was barely up to or a day and quit four times this month before it stuck the withdrawal was terrible i used medication from my last hospital stay to get through it i had tremors was terrified i would start seizing and hallucinated for days ive been sober for days today and every one has been hard a torn acl from a injury while i was drunk means i cant really walk what im also only just now realizing is this time is so much harder because i realize being sober will save my health but it wont solve everything else the problems i drank to avoid are still here i didnt drink because of what happened i drank because the situation i am and was in exceeds my coping skills it exceeds my mental health staying sober has become so hard because i finally realize being sober or drinking neither one solves my problems coping skills better life decisions and learning through mistakes does im days sober and feel like im hanging on to it by a thread and have never told this story before i have to admit that im fighting this demon minute by minute today even if you dont tell anyone just know if youre going through it someone else is too you really arent as alone as it seems thank you to anyone whose posts i read that gave me the courage to do this thank you,5,5

an underage brother with learning disabilities for some background my parents have both been functioning alcoholics for as long as i can remember my mother owns a company and is my boss i lived at home with my family until about years ago thanksgiving morning i came home from a night out with friends to my mother blackout drunk on the couch with food flaming on the stove i was understandably seriously concerned which in her stupor was taken as me cutting down her abilities to keep a home prepare a dinner i was kicked out for the umteenth time however this time felt like a last straw food thrown at me stuffing and potatos all over my clothes and bedroom boxes thrown at my head as i walk out the door i left everything there and moved in with my partner of over years and his mother and began paying rent there and making a more calm life for myself i started over left everything i owned there and i didnt look back and still havent my mother believes i chose to leave the family behind and to this day does not remember takes accountability for being the one to say the words to her child leave and never come back i hate you things started to feel separate and they are for the most part i wanted some type of relationship with my family i tried to create a relationship but with heavy boundaries over the last years i dont answer calls past pm i allow myself h to answer a text and i never go back to that house unless it is to see my brother for maximum hours maybe once a month i still work full time for my mom i am a part time artist and need the income plus i cant imagine her livelihood failing due to me stepping away i try to spend weekends with my dad because he stays sober at the art studio with me and is very supportive of my passions my brother is nearing adult age and is learning disabled to put it simply my parents have never given a shit it seems to teach him to take care of himself mentally or physically or hygienically he is at an age where he can choose to not listen to me and my advice either and i can not force his hands hes dropped out of highschool no license no ged no job and i feel he has no hope for himself and is extremely depressed he is also is trans with no support from my parents in terms of gender validation or therapeutic medical assistance i have been his main and only support system as far as accepting his identity which feels really basic but no other immediate or extended family seems to care are all very conservative and directly invalidate his existence which i cant even imagine that pretty much sums up where we are at without giving too many revealing details that would make it blatant who i am for if anyone in my family were to come across this so to start my mother was released from hospital less than weeks ago due to stomach ulcers which she refuses to admit are from the alcohol i was at her bedside awaiting her recovery the entire time and did everything in my power to make her comfortable and feel safe

a new low it has been an day binge unable to walk threatening to drive threatening their lives over the last days i have rescued my brother and taken him on drives and back home every day in the middle of my work i have waited around the neighborhood late at night terrified for their safety waiting for someone to fall and id be there to call in that i ended up happenstance rescuing their dog twice that they let out while blackout drunk and forgot i have taken an infinite amount of phone calls from my brother in a panic my mother in a stupor insulting me my father nonchalantly telling me to mind my business my extended family and coworkers concerned for my family as all theyve done is lie and put up a front about the addiction and its becoming too obvious to hide for the last years i have put up a wall and in weeks the wall and all of my boundaries have been chipped away and picked away and i am feeling defeated if my brother wasnt months from i would have called the cops and theyd probably be in jail or at least back in hospital unable to continue harming themselves and everyone around them at this point i would prefer them to be in care or jail and not able to continue doing this if i take those steps im terrified of what will happen to my brother i have no ability to take him in with me and i dont have the means to take care of a mentally disabled adult who my parents refused to parent and help im at a stage emotionally where i really dont care anymore i just want to be selfish im angry all my parents have done is be selfish and chose alcohol over raising me or my brother who needs more help than i do i want to fade away but i dont want to leave my brother in the dust im scared what would you do,1,4

right behavior severely deteriorated last months year starts fights constantly never used fight sitting hell start money usually work im primary breadwinner used money together constantly berating spending money making account every charge wanting see phone see money hiding etc separated owns house live hes always used like youre welcome letting live kind thing insists im grateful things tell

bad happen ever since open season hes blaming saying relationship stressful thats hes drinking says make anxious always thinks im mad im literally never mad man come home excited see every day also dont know version ill get time hes telling hes unhappy nothing makes happy anymore started married questioning entire reality last month happy place much fun together always best relationship despite addiction drinking become lot problematic trying hide drinking driving drinking around work etc used dont think im treating differently outside tougher drinking driving said made appointment couples therapist specializes addiction well hes trying behavior alarming im sure even invest like turning point behaviors hes exhibiting typical alcoholic im middle getting ready trial summer fall cousin saed back really dont want make decisions uprooting life thats keeps coming guns blazing really dont know advice would appreciated,my husband is an alcoholic and idk whats going on anymore hi everyone my husband m is an alcoholic and has been the entire time weve been together when we first met i f picked up on it pretty quickly i found he was drinking liter of vodka a day im a nurse and not a lot gets by me unfortunately that being said in the past i would have immediately left upon discovering an addiction issue and i found this out pretty early on however for some reason i felt like this situation was different and maybe part of me still thinks that i thought about how militant and determined my husband is and how he has an amazing family who would be supportive beyond supportive and me i felt like i was looking at a broken person and i felt like he deserved someone to help him through this awfulness over the course of years i began slowly and gently trying to introduce the idea of his drinking being potentially abnormal he wasnt receptive of my early attempts however he ended up having a wd seizure right after we got engaged he had taken on a temporary second job and genuinely didnt have time to drink so after a few days i woke up to him seizing on our kitchen floor they did bloodwork in the er and his liver values were triple the normal range after this happened he got more serious about addressing the issue from there he cut his drinking down significantly there would be periods where he wouldnt drink every day and on the days he did drink it was much less than before it wasnt perfect but a lot of progress was made he ended up getting his bloodwork rechecked and his liver function returned to normal bc of all the work he had been doing problem being i think he took this as a license to drink again at this point i wasnt pushing hard for anything in particular just maintained my patience and having small talks when the opportunity arose offering resources if he was interested well at some point i went to his job for an event that he was working as an employee for and he was drinking i watched him talking to his boss and other leadershipscoworkers all while hed been drinking and continuing to drink out of a shaker bottle his parents were there as well so that was obviously a thing we had a serious talk about the severity of the situation his parents also called them bc they also noticed that inspired a bit of change but it wasnt until he came home drunk from work and i wrote him a letter telling him how scary his drinking had become to me after this letter he was sober for days but relapsed and has been hit or miss since my real issue right now is his behavior has severely deteriorated over the last months year he starts fights constantly when we never used to fight at all i can just be sitting there and hell just start in on me about money usually we both work but im the primary breadwinner we used to have our money together but he was constantly berating me about what i was spending money on making me account for every charge wanting to see my phone to see if i had money i was hiding from him etc so we separated it he owns the house we live in and hes always used that against me like youre welcome for letting you live here kind of thing and he insists im not grateful for the things he does for me i tell him thank you all the time for the things he does for me the thing is of the time things are great weve always gotten along amazingly well never fought always on the same page he finally started opening up to me when he relapsed about his mental health issues he struggles with being open about how hes feeling or doing he told me the only time he felt at peace and relaxed is when were just hanging out together doing our thing and i thought we were in a really good place he started coming home drunk again and at the end of the week he was about to go to another event at his job and i was pretty sure he had been drinking so i asked him if he had been drinking to please stay home bc i didnt want anything bad to happen to him ever since then its been open season on me hes blaming me saying our relationship is stressful and thats why hes drinking he says i make him anxious and he always thinks im mad at him im literally never mad at this man i come home excited to see him every day but i also dont know which version of him ill get all the time hes telling me hes unhappy that nothing makes him happy anymore and it started when he married me this has me questioning my entire reality when last month i was his only happy place we have so much fun together and have always had the best relationship despite his addiction his drinking has become a lot more problematic trying to hide it and drinking and driving drinking around work etc than it used to be but i dont think im treating him any differently outside of being tougher on him about drinking and driving all that being said he made an appointment with a couples therapist who specializes in addiction as well so hes trying but his behavior is so alarming to me that im not sure if i should even invest any more of myself here or is this like the turning point are these behaviors hes exhibiting typical for an alcoholic im in the middle of getting ready for a trial this summer and fall from when my cousin saed me back in so i really dont want to make any decisions about uprooting my life until thats over but he keeps coming at me guns blazing i really dont know what to do any and all advice would be appreciated,40,73

hurting need think really need sometimes means cutting people goes physical locations inanimate objects well find anything works works may help someone else works might seem alien totally unreasonable somebody else long keeps clean thats need get help need dont alone feel falter begin fail thousands people know help might even know exactly going look doesnt perfect still mess sober everyday sober better even arent best least know youre trying sooooo invoke fifth rule last year quit job without going nitty gritty worked smaller business people total put mildly sober loved job liked guys worked became clear healthy around one may even dealing needless say soon found extent substance abuse going behind scenes left next day turned better got new job less toxic people im much happier four years job rough sometimes may even seem impossible still better without people destroy simply care experience narcissistic addictive behaviors tend come together extreme cases abuse may even aware youve removed life important take stock things around regularly check healthy helpful otherwise get stuck patterns damn hard get sorry word vomit think important least talk following advice awesome never get bored never stop good luck happy st patricks day,happy st patricks day at years sober hello all and happy st patricks day today i have been sober for years over that time i made myself some guidelines to help and remind me of what i need to do just having the perspective and written down rules has helped me you have to want to quit all the selfhelp books and all the support groups in the world are not going to help you if you dont actually want to quit find a reason to quit any reason outside of yourself that can make you accountable start small and build from there responsibility can be a hell of a driving force when its something you care about redirect the the urge to something beneficial as an addict i have the superhuman ability to pour all of myself into something that gives me joy replacing the bad behaviors with something improves your current situation can help while keeping you busy never get bored im a machine of habit when i get bored i get back into whatever habit thats easiest for me building new habits takes time dont give up if needed remove the people and things that allow you to continue the addiction this one sucks it hurts to lose someone that was close to you but when the people around you arent helping you or in some cases actively hurting you then you need to think about what you really need to do and sometimes that means cutting people out this goes for physical locations and inanimate objects as well find anything that works for you what works for you may not help someone else what works for me might seem alien and totally unreasonable to somebody else but as long as it keeps me clean then thats what i need to do get help if you need it you dont have to do this alone if you feel yourself falter or begin to fail there are thousands of people that know how to help and might even know exactly what you are going through you just have to look it doesnt all have to be the perfect you can still be a mess and be sober everyday sober is better even if you arent the best at least you know youre trying sooooo i had to invoke my fifth rule this last year i quit my job without going into the nitty gritty of it all i worked at a smaller business of about people total and to put it mildly they were not sober i loved that job i liked the guys i worked with but it became clear to me that they were not healthy for me to be around one of them may even have been dealing needless to say as soon as i found out the extent of the substance abuse going on behind the scenes i left the next day it all turned out for the better i got a new job with less toxic people and im much happier here than the four years i was at my other job it can be rough sometimes it may even seem impossible but you will still be better without the people that destroy you and simply do not care about you from my experience narcissistic and addictive behaviors tend to come together in the more extreme cases of abuse and you may not even be aware of it until after youve removed them from your life it is important to take stock of the things around you and regularly check if its healthy and helpful otherwise you get stuck in your patterns again and it is so damn hard to get out of them sorry for the word vomit but i think it was important for me to at least talk about following my own advice you are all awesome you can do this never get bored and never stop good luck to all of you and happy st patricks day,10,1

going peach prc concert one inspirations giving alcohol thank reading got far fing proud happy far ive come im genuinely shocked ive made far heres many years sobriety,years sober heres my story as im f two years sober tomorrow hell yeah i wanted to be vulnerable and share some of my experiences do be aware before you start reading i am talking about my experiences with addiction and so this might be triggering so if youre not in a good space then lovingly please skip this one since trying alcohol as a teenager i had struggled with having way too much and often blacking out and putting myself in dangerous and embarrassing situations and causing myself to have the worst hangovers imaginable i tried quitting so many times but would always end up drinking again a couple times i was so drunk and staying at a friends house that i pissed myself in my sleep the most embarrassing thing ever and yet i still couldnt give it up another time i was by myself in my uni halls and i woke up realising i had pissed on my floor in my room this is really embarrassing to share but i think its important to include from around the ages of my hangovers got seriously bad to the point where i would be throwing up constantly for the whole of the day after i would often spend the day in bed puking into my bin and struggling to get anything down a few times it landed me in the hospital because i needed iv fluids one day i went out for lunch with some friends and started drinking at lunch then spent the rest of the day drinking and then being ill i would find every excuse to drink when i went on a holiday with my dad i spent every other night getting completely plastered and then spending the following day in bed with my head in a bin i went to a concert with my best friend and i ended up getting so many drinks i barely remember the second half of the concert i spent the next day throwing up in a train toilet on my way back home visiting my parents was a big trigger for me drinking and i would often spend an evening drinking and again spending the next day being ill the amount i would drink was often completely excessive and i would cause arguments with friends who were just trying to help cut me off at the end of the night my life revolved around the next time id be drinking i was in complete denial one hosptial trip i had a chat with a mental health nurse and after opening up about my struggles she told me its normal for students to drink the normalisation of drinking to excess especially for young people in my country england is so bad the last time i drank i had gone to the pub with some friends and i only drank two pints which for me was a big achievement however i still ended up constantly throwing up the next day so my friends took me to ae that was a massive wake up call for me and it was incredibly difficult but it somehow ended up being the last time i ever drank the excessive drinking and puking caused me to develop gastritis and so i had to take a ppi for several months my friends helped me so much and were there for me throughout the whole journey and i am forever grateful i have drifted from some of them but i will never forget how them encouraged me and kept me going i still struggle with cravings fairly often but drinking alcohol free drinks helps massively and therapy therapy has been a real lifesaver for me a massive reason i would drink was to avoid certain thoughts and feelings starting trauma therapy was one of the hardest things ive ever done but also arguably the best thing ive ever done and will continue to do for the last few months of quitting drinking and after i was addicted to weed and that funnily enough did help me give up alcohol too because i basically switched from one substance to another until a few months later when i went fully sober after developing chs cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome but thats a story for another day since being diagnosed with pots i realise that along with the sheer amount i would drink the reason my hangovers were always so unbearable is because they would trigger a pots flare up i dont think past me would believe me if i told them that i am now years sober and actually doing okay i still struggle a lot but i always remind myself how much worse things could be if i was still in active addiction so heres to me for getting through it i also want to share some experiences some beautiful some dreadful but all would have been ruined or made far worse if i was still drinking i need to remind myself why i gave up and how much better things are for doing so my graduation if i was still drinking i would have ended up drunk and forgetting half the day but instead i celebrated with my best friend and my cousin with a wholesome meal and alcohol free prosecco going through chs while working an intense cleaning job and finding out my dad was seriously ill its almost like my vomiting from alcohol latched onto cannabis and made me give that up too i was very tempted to relapse with alcohol but i stuck it through being in crisis while my dad was dying he was but living a few hours away and when i would visit getting triggered about being in my childhood home getting diagnosed with pots and having so much of my life finally make sense and learning how to make things easier for myself alcohol is a trigger for pots so theres even more reason to stick to sobriety now going to a peach prc concert she was one of my inspirations for giving up alcohol thank you for reading if you got this far i am so fing proud of myself and so happy with how far ive come im genuinely so shocked ive made it this far but i did and heres to many more years of sobriety,23,6

puking next day hangover stupid ugly shit drunk like shitting bathroom floor wiping around trying clean couldnt drunk like thats embarrassing know logically thats enough make want stop cant dont want alcohol genuinely thing removes ache soul days barely tolerate addiction basically genetic everyone family outside sister form addiction mom alcohol cigarettes shes quitting alcohol though grandmother ciggerettes brother weed maybe alcohol self harm potentially alcohol ciggerettes dont often fast build tolerance dont see point smoking doesnt give buzz strong enough personally smoke believe tolerance lowered enough probably exaggerating really anxious almost alcohol dont even drink much often comforts dont know acquire brother plug hes really protective smokes weed highly doubt hed buy bottle alcohol keep room days ill another opportunity get drunk brother girlfriend hate admit reason agreed go would alcohol im actually petrified brother girlfriend might make uncomfortable doubt theyd anything seeing basic pda makes uncomfortable due past expirences aka person bought alchohol phone sex sent pics actually kind thing even groom since lol alcohol havent much experience drugs except dmt honestly actually nd best feeling life wasnt used guy could molest would probably number one list dmt amazing doesnt last long effects hit like opened new reality drug ive weed nice lasts long im still makes sense would aware enough want things high said things properly alcohol removes anything melt bed chill except skin itchy thing usually stop via self harm lol,i dont know what to do what are you supposed to do when the one thing that makes you feel good is also the thing thats destroying your mental health tw also mentions of self harm and groomingsa but its not the main point of the post ill start this off by saying im sorry if this is against the rules i read them and i dont think it is im not an alcoholic and i am not trying to romantize iti do talk about how it feels good but i also mention the parts that suck however i most definitely have an unhealthy relationship with alcohol but once again sorry if i broke the rules i just really need to talkvent about it the first time i ever got drunk i was it was and still is the best feeling i have ever felt ever since i can remember ive always had this ache in my chest like there is something sitting on it and weighing me down not a physical ache though alcohol removes that ache when im drunk its like it wasnt there to begin with i can relax and feel good its the one time i am not plagued with crippling anxiety and memories even when i am sad and drunk its like this calm melancholy way that still somehow feels good does that make sense i am almost now i have only gotten drunk a handful of times but it feels the same amazing way i dont drink often only because i cant legally buy it and i dont have anyone willing to get me a bottle thats it im honestly scared for when i turn and i can start being choosey with the alcohol i buy that is a genuine fear of mine i cant stand it when people around drink me when i cant i went to a restaurant with my my mom my sister my brother and some of their friends everyone but me and my brother ordered alcohol and i had to sit there and pretend it didnt bother me its like my skin itches and i get a certain restlessness and due to me being obviously underage its not like i can ask to try it i am nervous the bottle i have hidden in my room which i got via whoring myself out basically is almost empty theres not enough alcohol in it to get me comfortably drunk tipsy yes but not drunk so its not even like i get my last horrah and finish it while feeling satisfied and i like being drunk tipsy is nice but i am still myself if that makes sense i dont drink often and ive had that bottle in my room for a while now but knowing its there has given me a sense of comfort like a just in case if anything becomes too much and im also mad at myself i hate the fact that last time i drank i only got a little more than tipsy i wish i had gotten drunk because that felt like my last opportunity and i dont know what to do i cant steal alcohol as ive already stolen a big portion of the alcohol from the alcohol cabinet and its wrong if i steal more itll be noticed but the person who got me the alcohol the last time moved away so i cant even beg him to buy it for me i literally cant seem to control myself around alchohol especially if it is an alcohol i enjoy the taste of it takes me so long to finish a bottle because my family buys hard liquor only nd i hate the taste even if i prefer it because you get more drunk with less volume of alcohol but when i get in the mood to drink that dislike doesnt last long i once drank half a oz bottle of straight voldka once did i severly harm myself puke on myself and then go to bed covered in vomit and blood yes did i feel like literal hell the next day and had to pretend to be sick also yes but its like my brain only latches onto the good parts of drinking and ignores the bad stuff it forgets how horrible i feel the next day the fact that i have on multiple occasions drank myself to blacking out and puking then the next day when i have a hangover or the stupid ugly shit i do while drunk like shitting on the bathroom floor and wiping it around trying to clean it but couldnt because i was too drunk like thats embarrassing and i know logically thats should be enough to make me want to stop but i cant and i dont want to alcohol genuinely is the only thing that removes this ache in my soul these days i can barely tolerate it addiction is basically genetic and everyone in my family outside of my sister has a form of addiction for my mom alcohol and cigarettes shes quitting alcohol though for my grandmother ciggerettes for my brother weed and maybe alcohol for me self harm and potentially alcohol and ciggerettes but i dont do that often because of how fast i build a tolerance and i dont see the point in smoking if it doesnt give me a buzz its not strong enough for me personally but i do smoke if i believe my tolerance has lowered enough i am probably exaggerating but i am really anxious that i am almost out of alcohol i dont even drink that much or often but having it there comforts me and i dont know what to do or how to acquire it my brother has a plug but hes really protective over me he now smokes weed with me but i highly doubt hed buy me a bottle of alcohol that i can just keep in my room for myself in a few days ill have another opportunity to get drunk with my brother and his girlfriend and i hate to admit it but the only reason i agreed to go was because there would be alcohol im actually very petrified that my brother and his girlfriend might make me uncomfortable i doubt theyd do anything there but seeing the most basic pda makes me uncomfortable due to past expirences aka the person who bought be alchohol because i had phone sex with them and sent pics of myself were actually kind of a thing even if he did groom me since i was lol its not just alcohol but i havent had much experience with other drugs except dmt which honestly was actually the nd best feeling in my life and if it wasnt used just so the guy could molest me it would probably be number one on the list dmt was amazing and it doesnt last too long and when the effects do hit it was like being opened up to a new reality the only other drug ive had is weed which is nice but it lasts too long and im still myself if that makes sense i would be aware enough to want to do things but too high to do said things properly while with alcohol it just removes any will to do anything and i just melt into my bed and chill except for when my skin does the itchy thing but i usually just stop it via self harm lol,2,5

shitty person mention shitty son man ive always looked im terrified hell take hes prone angry outbursts nothing violent hes like honestly starts yelling screaming really reason blame im still scared confrontation knowing im going disappointing admitting ive breaking trust long asked roommate would willing come sort mediator someone could help stand corner help see things perspective alcoholism mental health issuedisease something im proud im genuinely asking forgiveness especially dads support getting treatment godsend roommate course agreed go definitely took bit weight shoulders im still petrified though itll days roommate go place visit know ill bring letter wrote hope hell patience read way maybe could way ease tension could caused simply jumping im alcoholic conversation im still really scared im dont even feel like adult admit maturity five year old dont want dad know hes father fuck hes already disappointed lot ways im scared nail coffin seals seeing waste son anything else aside letter write roommate accompany support us conversation want avoid much tension possible want dad still love,im going to bite the bullet im telling my dad im an alcoholic next week i started having a drinking problem not long after turning im now and alcoholism has slowly and brutally been ruining my life it has been leading me into other avenues of addiction that i never thought would follow as a consequence ive had dts my roommates had to hold me in his lap while shaking and screaming uncontrollably more times than id like to think about im surprised that my friends who know about my problem are not only still my friends but also so unbelievably patient and compassionate i dont deserve the luck ive had in that regard im probably only alive still because of my roommate man deserves the whole world for dealing with such a trash person after a really dangerously bad period of drinking a few months ago i started doing a little better on my own lately though its been getting bad again and now drug abuse is getting mixed in with it enough is enough i talked to some other friends got some support opinions etc i decided to write my dad a letter apologizing for hiding the fact im an alcoholic from him and for the inevitable disappointment he will feel and the anger thatll likely follow i know i need to reach out to my dad i could probably get through treatment and into therapies with the help of my friends but my dad is my dad we just got each other my mothers an alcoholic so at the end of the day it really is just me and my dad when it comes to family i cant justify lying deceiving stealing from him and hiding all of this from him anymore i know what im doing makes me a shitty person not to mention being a shitty son to the man ive always looked up to im terrified about how hell take it hes prone to angry outbursts nothing violent hes not like that and honestly if he starts yelling and screaming i really have no reason to blame him but im still scared of the confrontation and knowing that im going to be disappointing him and admitting that ive been breaking his trust for so long now so i asked my roommate if he would be willing to come with me as a sort of mediator someone who could help stand in my corner and help him see things from my perspective of alcoholism being a mental health issuedisease and not something im proud of and that im genuinely asking for forgiveness and especially for my dads support in getting me treatment my godsend of a roommate of course agreed to go with me that definitely took a bit of weight off my shoulders im still petrified though itll only be a few days now before my roommate and i go out to his place to visit him i know ill bring the letter i wrote to him and hope hell have the patience to read it all the way through and that maybe it could be a way to ease any tension that could be caused by just simply jumping into an im an alcoholic conversation im just still really scared im i dont even feel like an adult i can admit i have the maturity of a five year old i dont want to have to have my dad know that hes the father of a fuck up hes already disappointed in me in a lot of other ways im just scared that this will be the nail on the coffin that seals him seeing me as a waste of a son is there anything else i can do aside from the letter i write him and having my roommate accompany me for support and being there with us during the conversation i want to avoid as much tension as possible i just want my dad to still love me,5,6

help,can a partners binge drinking make you crazy this is my very first reddit post thank you for readingi f met my bf m three years ago in the fall for reference i journal and have timesdates of all the crazy shit that has gone down upon reflection i printed off two years of calendars and taped them to the wall and put in my journal entries i saw a pattern binge drinking at least every weeks when i met him he had been sober for a year that same weekend he went off the wagon at a concert he called me every few hours the entire weekend that should have been my first sign for the first three months it seemed amazing he showered me with gifts and calls and took me on a trip and concert it was exciting for reference he was a mover and shaker an entrepreneur and people always called him he seemed to be on top of the world the he spent buying everyone shots at the bar on one night should have been the second red flag maybe fast forward to christmas eve day we have plans to head to my relatives that night he was supposed to be home the day before but he got drunk instead and was still not home he told me he needed to go shopping for new clothes and he arrived at my house after spending wtf i take him to my relatives he gets blind drunk and on our way home at midnight he wanted to be dropped off at his uncles he had no way home so he had to walk to my house at am on dec th and it took him two hours needless to say he missed xmas brunch at my house the next day as he was hungover in bed next month trip to carribean he does cocaine and drink the entire time it was messy four weeks later he shows up to my dads birthday dinner after i told him not to come because he was drunk and mortifies me in front of everyone by asking when i was going to have kids next month says were going away plane ticket booked i wait he doesnt show up come to find out he was passed out at home im confused i think hes a drinker i have not gone through seven days with him without him getting drunk hes struggling whats going on hes not sleeping its not my job to fix or control him i dont know what to do hes a lovely kind man but he has demons and i fear they are winning the alcohol is just destroying his life his potential his health and his mood the balls are dropping its making me feel uncertain chaotic and unstable hes at risk what do i do april the drinking is escalating hes drinking and driving hes doing cocaine and binge drinking the pills he is highly stressed and im worried im not sure what the next few months will look like the distance is growing between us its making me feel uncomfortable im worried im uncertain and now im drugging myself with ativan to calm my nerves have we made any fun memories down south was just a drunkcocaine fest april im excited to teach him to play cribbage we havent really played many fun things together but he got drunk and left me at his house and he went to his cousins april monday rolls around and he gets drunk april i went down at he was still in bed i was concerned for him he threatened suicide but i thought ok lets sort this out i pray this is his wakeup call things are going to get better he promises just two days later i thought we were going to have a nice night together april he left me on his couch went over to his grandfathers and returned three hours later he was high on those vivance pills i hate those pills and how they change his personality april we were going to have dinner sunday night but he ended up drunk hes moody the balls are dropping and i dont want to be around him which leads to what i interpret as chaos i dont know whats happening to him whats happening now is that im losing faith im becoming cynical basically the whole time together hes been off the wagon i wish he would stop drinking my personality is changing im getting moody april was supposed to cook me dinner and run me a tub instead he gets drunk my birthday is in two days he makes no plans and forgets im pissed he goes away for work and ends up going to the strippers and getting drunk may i went out to see him after my night out i wanted to stay but hes drunk in bed passed out may he went over to his friends who breeds dogs got drunk drove home drunk with a dog back he then tells me this is my birthday gift what the fuck is going on may were supposed to go to a bbq and cuddle that night he went out drinking i told him not to bother coming because he was drunk may date night i showed up and he was on those speed pills his grandmother told me not to get in the car with him because he was drinking i asked him about my birthday gift it still hasnt arrived he basically dismissed me commenting on the fact that it shouldnt matter as im i am feeling unstable overwhelmed and confused hes using speed pills and alcohol firing a gun off in the house drinking and driving this behaviour is out of control what are my solutions wait and see how the next two months flush out i think thats what im gon na do he wasnt drinking last year and he said that was really good im going to book an appointment with a counselor im gon na talk to her hopefully things will turn around i really hope the drinking stops june i get a text from his friend telling me hes taking him home and putting him to bed so much for our plans last night i am angry june im beyond angry im upset im willing to work it out with him this is my last straw he said hed go to counselling june i feel our relationship was goodbut its not good now my health is getting affected i think he needs to get help this is not my dream relationship its sad that alcohol and substance misuse are ruining our relationship june spent the day organizing his paperwork ended up working late he arrives home at drunk high on pills and smoking and he did cocaine i see a large amount of cocaine at the house i mean a large amount im done i cant handle this shit anymore i need to figure out what to do next one of my feet is out the door june ran into him at the mall i told him i had one foot out the door i was tired upset and frustrated july he flies back from work and goes out all night i call him when hes out but he wont tell me where he is hes drinking he says he has business its saturday night and i can hear girls around he comes home at am tells me he didnt come home because my friend was at the condo what kind of excuse is that july i missed it be kind to yourself he has multiple phones mob made man some form of illegal commodity cash shooting gun off in house drunk driving and ripping off the deck out all night my parents have been approached to warn me that he might be a drug dealer august i let him back in but its hard im feeling anxious what if its true am i staying because i want a kid i need emotional regulation this is hard when i pushed him and asked him the name of the guy that was driving he snapped and said are you trying to get me killed this is testing my ethics and morals what if everything got seized what if i get caught up in the mess i was told i am worried what am i missing here whats happening now is that im losing my faith i dont want to be around his energy im becoming cynical august i thought he was asleep in bed in the hotel so i shut off the tv he says what the fuck did you do that for wft is his problem sept airport hotel cursed me again i was angry and yelled and said to never talk to me like that again i dont even like him anymore on he drinks a whole bottle of wine at dinner then a few doubles dinner is tense and we get back to the hotel and go to the bar stumbles in a few hours later more drunk what a mess this is sept i feel impatientrepulsed around him when he drinks i dont like how his demeanourmood shifts binge drinking four times this past week saying hes feeling mothered i cant fix him he needs to fix himself its not the fact that he drinks that i care about its the negative impacts the next day im losing my health because im giving away my good

appreciated,overthinking rumination and guilt my anxiety is really bad at the moment i am weeks pregnant and just feel like i am going over and over the same thing constantly in my head my anxiety manifests as overthinking over analysing everything i say and do leaving conversations embarrassed or ashamed worried i upset or offended someone talking too fast in social situations talking too much oversharing thinking about past situations over and over distorted reality when recounting the situations need to seek reassurance catastrophizing rumination feelings of guilt constant fear of saying or doing the wrong thing feeling of dread feelings of panic and panic attacks wanting to avoid speaking to others constant worry about being judged feeling like i am a bad person i seem to be fine in social situations at the time and can be quite sociable but its the aftermath of that that leaves me feeling and frightened how do i stop this it is taking over my life i have had friends over tonight some of whom also struggle with anxiety and now i feel like i just talked too much at them and didnt listen i dont even know if this is true its just how i feel right now in the aftermath i want to be a good friend and listener but i worry i am incapable i cant trust myself to do or say anything anymore i always say and do the wrong thing i had a meeting with a mental health midwife today and just left the appointment feeling like i said too much and fear they might think i am unstable or something i told them that my anxiety started about years ago when i had my first and last weed brownie in uni that caused a huge panic attack after that i developed derealisation and depersonalization and had that for about months once that subsided i just developed regular anxiety that i managed ok with betterhelp and other things but since getting pregnant it has escalated since telling my midwife that i am terrified that they will put that on my records and ill be kept on some list to monitor i know this is probably irrational but its how i feel right now like most other episodes i will likely feel ok in a few days and i will realise how ridiculous ive been but right now i just feel dread i handle the big stuff in my life well but the small things like a conversation or saying the wrong thing play on my mind no end i just want to feel and act normally otherwise i worry i will just need to avoid social situations altogether i feel like im self obsessed because my anxiety stems from being worried about how others view me i just want to be a good person i want to trust that i am and can be a good friend sister mum i am so excited to have this baby i have my own house a good job an amazing relationship with my partner so i feel silly feeling this way i am seeking help with the midwife so i can be the best version of myself when baby comes i would hate to be worrying over things like this after theyre born does anyone else experience this has anyone overcome it i am sorry

get outside house every day live others none helping feel like brain inflamed sick thoughts intrusive used live life anticipation future thinking happy memories past like something shook strongly reminded really realization sobering grieving everything lost lose keep thinking everyone love die beautiful birds watch every day die opossum bird feeder night die precious cats die makes anxious point genuinely feeling ill go anywhere anything without constant anxious panic death assume humans think mortality making depressed sad generally happy person love life feel like ive mentally hit weight wont lift lover nature environmentalist always found much awe beauty nature look trees creeks see reflection sadness constant anxiety ive lived whole life die doesnt bring peace knowing atoms dissipate makes sick know right know stripped away nothing point feels like sick game humans gone far rails everything society seems like unhealthy coping strategy look strangers think fleeting existence think terrible ways humans treat earth heart full grief amount suffering witnessing literally even look lobster tanks grocery store without wanting bawl eyes worst part death starting sound peaceful least wont think love thinking dont want die keep imaging screaming crawling final days see terror makes think blackness death dont even experience death sheer terror ugh makes sick want live long happy life far hardest experience life ive go im sad crying time death death us isolated society know doesnt help depression anxiety ptsd mix,i cant stop feeling extremely anxious about death hey guys i posted a couple days ago re struggling with recurring panic attacks and nocturnal panic attacks they have made me physically and mentally exhausted my soul feels tired they have also abruptly shook me to my core and made me come face to face with the fact that i am going to die the panic attacks would come and my brain would say youre going to drop dead and now that thought is on loop it makes my head fuzzy i do yoga i eat well i run i live in nature i tend to a garden i get outside the house every day i live with others and none of its helping i feel like my brain is inflamed or sick because the thoughts are so intrusive i used to live my life in anticipation of the future or thinking happy memories in the past but its like something shook me so strongly and reminded me that all we really have is now and that realization is sobering i am grieving everything i have lost and will lose i keep thinking about how everyone i love will die all the beautiful birds i watch every day they will die the opossum under my bird feeder at night will die my precious cats will die it makes me so anxious to the point where i am genuinely feeling ill and i can not go anywhere or do anything without this constant anxious panic about death i assume most humans think about mortality but it is making me depressed and sad i have been a generally happy person and i love life but i feel like ive been mentally hit with a weight that just wont lift i am a lover of nature and environmentalist and have always found so much awe and beauty in nature but now when i look out at the trees or the creeks i just see my own reflection of sadness and the constant anxiety ive lived with my whole life why do we have to die it doesnt bring me peace knowing my atoms will dissipate it makes me sick all i know is right before me and all i know will be stripped away into nothing so what is the point what are we doing here it feels like a sick game and humans have gone so far off the rails that everything in our society seems like it is just some unhealthy coping strategy i look at strangers and think of how fleeting their existence is too i think about all the terrible ways humans treat each other and the earth and my heart is just so full of grief for the amount of suffering i am witnessing i literally can not even look at lobster tanks in the grocery store without wanting to bawl my eyes out the worst part is that death is starting to sound peaceful because at least i wont have to think but i love thinking and i dont want to die i keep imaging myself screaming and crawling during my final days and all i see is terror it makes me think about the blackness after death we dont even experience death what if its because of the sheer terror of it all ugh it makes me sick i am only and i want to live a long and happy life but this is by far the hardest experience in my life ive had to go through im just so sad i am crying all the time over my own death and the death of us all i have isolated myself from society and i know that doesnt help is this just depression anxiety ptsd a mix of it all,25,14

classmates thenwe hardly spoke switched virtual classes started reaching facebook person listened problems crisis appreciate also shared struggles like crush multiple girls friends rejected even told colombian virtual girlfriend missed years younger gave weird vibes dont want judge anyone appearance guy appropriate could see many girls rejected honestly bothers hes crushes many female friends claim hes liked along years said hes feelings since day saw intimidated tell honestly dont believe allif true wouldve said something earlier havent seen years even tried meet park made excuse see hes extremely clingy seems develop obsessions girl gives attention likely tied deep insecurities think hes stuck worrying state limerence started asked stop messaging much yet honestly made extremely uncomfortable kept writing many times asking etc ended friendship realized blocked instagram reached via gmail ask said heartbroken said said couldnt handle friends someone likes clear nothing would ever happen us honestly feel like ending friendship right choice dont feel comfortable since confessed first time fact messaged many times social media clear serious selfesteem issues even must admit rejected beginning didnt guts getting fact guy crush rejected didnt want reject thought would make bad person mindset years old final message told consider seeing psychologist made sure say considerate way possible seemed like started panic attack cried said top person things like appreciate didnt want talk anymore defended point view situation point cant stop thinking fact still feelings makes sick wish person would forget stop searching social media platform feel mix guilt disgust allowed continue three years letting someone selfesteem issues become attached feel extremely anxious disgusted situation feel fact confessed feelings ruined totally way see cant see friendly person anymore sometimes think person projection younger remember obsessed crush instantly rejected fine friend years week im like anymore,i feel sick and very nauseous because my exbest friend of years confessed his feelings for me a second time after i ghosted his first confession i never had a crush on him ive gone two days without eating and had terrible sleepi kept waking up every two hours and couldnt find a comfortable position in bed after hearing his second confession about him wanting to date me i instantly rejected him in the most direct way possible i told him i wanted to end our friendship because i simply couldnt stand the idea of staying friends with someone who has romantic or sexual feelings for me when i dont feel the same for three years to he kept messaging me on every social media platformwhatsapp instagram gmail every crazy days or a month id reply occasionally telling him i was doing fine but exhausted from studying i was giving everything i had to get into my dream college and get the best grades in the first time he confessed his feelings i ghosted him it happened during one of the hardest moments in my life i had just lost a close friend to cancer and was deeply depressed while i was sharing this grief with him he suddenly said i need to tell you something well i really like you i was completely shocked my mind went blank he was someone i considered a friend and had confided in about all my mental struggles during the pandemic in i left with emotional scars because a fake friend gossiped things about me to my exboyfriend wed been mere classmates before thenwe hardly spoke but when we switched to virtual classes he started reaching out on facebook he was the only person who listened to my problems during my crisis and i appreciate that about him he also shared his struggles with me like he had a crush on multiple girls i was friends with most of whom rejected him he even told me about a colombian virtual girlfriend he missed who was years younger than him and this gave me weird vibes from him i dont want to judge anyone by their appearance but this guy was not very appropriate and i could see why many girls rejected him honestly it bothers me that hes had crushes on many female friends i had only to now claim hes liked me all along during these years he said hes had feelings for me since the day he saw me but was too intimidated to tell me i honestly dont believe him at allif that were true he wouldve said something earlier we havent seen each other in years he even tried to meet me in the park but i just made an excuse to not see him to me hes extremely clingy and seems to develop obsessions with any girl who gives him attention likely tied to his deep insecurities i think hes stuck in a worrying state of limerence it all started when i asked him to stop messaging me so much and yet he did it again honestly it made me extremely uncomfortable that he kept writing to me so many times asking what i was doing how i was where i was etc after i ended our friendship i realized he blocked me on instagram i reached out via gmail to ask why and he said he was heartbroken of what i said i said i couldnt handle being friends with someone who likes me when it is clear nothing would ever happen between us honestly i feel like ending the friendship was the right choice for me i dont feel comfortable since he confessed me for the first time and the fact that he messaged me so many times in all my social media it was clear to me that he had serious selfesteem issues even before then i must admit that i should have rejected him from the beginning but i didnt have the guts to do it i was getting over the fact that a guy i had a crush rejected me and i didnt want to reject him because i thought it would make me a bad person but that was my mindset at years old in my final message i told him that he should consider seeing a psychologist but i made sure to say it in the most considerate way possible it seemed like he started to have a panic attack and cried because he said that i was the top person and things like that and that i did not appreciate that he didnt want to talk to me anymore i defended my point of view of this situation the point is i cant stop thinking about this and the fact that he still has feelings for me makes me sick i wish this person would forget about me and stop searching for me on any social media platform i feel a mix of guilt and disgust for having allowed this to continue for three years and for letting someone with selfesteem issues become so attached to me i feel extremely anxious and disgusted about this situation i feel the fact that he confessed to me his feelings ruined totally the way i see him i cant see him as a friendly person anymore sometimes i think this person is a projection of who i was when i was younger because i remember being obsessed with my crush too i was instantly rejected which was fine but it was not a friend of years it was of week but im not like that anymore,1,0

therapist time attributed combo hydroxyzine prozac knows dont know point im afraid lexapro qt prolongation know basically ssris cause prozac sertraline seem lowest risk severe anxietyhealth anxiety panic disorder helped feel like im going crazy dont want become dependent xanax tldr need ssri panic disorder want know prozac zoloft best terms effectiveness side effects medications recommended lexapro,prozac or zoloft or others apologies for long post but looking for some advice or just hearing other experiences i f was diagnosed with panic disorder about years ago around when i was or years old along with agoraphobia and gad my current dxs are panic disorder gad adhd hypochondriasis major depression ocd and ptsd yay me up until recently my anxiety and depression were managed or had gone into a remission of sorts where i was only using hydroxyzine mg as needed for moments when i felt that i couldnt calm myself down this was probably a handful of times in a month i believe due to semaglutide ive had a reemergence of extreme anxiety panic attacks and severe health anxiety the last two weeks have been a living hell i took semaglutide mg from until and the first weeks it was great i had mild side effects when i increased my dose to mg it all went downhill from there i started having intense nausea and developed a fear of even going to the restroom because i was afraid of passing out or worse my anxiety was high due to this and i was taking my hydroxyzine daily up to mg just to be able to relax i went back down to mg on the sema for a couple weeks but the anxiety and nausea became debilitating so i stopped even with zofran mg added in i had reached out to my pcp about getting on a daily treatment for the anxiety as it had been almost years since i was taking anything consistently and he prescribed lexapro mg when i went to pick up the rx though the pharmacist warned me that the hydroxyzine zofran and lexapro all have a risk of qt prolongation and i should reach out to my doctor for guidance well reader thats when things started spiraling for the worst i never took the lexapro i stopped taking the zofran and now i was terrified of taking my hydroxyzine due to this potential heart arryhthmia apparently its not meant for long term use and ive been on it prn for years i was having constant panic attacks that i had damaged my heart or had some serious medical condition going on and i couldnt even get relief because i was afraid to take anything at all ended up getting with my therapist twice in two days got with a psychiatrist and was prescribed mg xanax up to twice a day had two normal ekgs a normal head ct and now will have an abdominalchest ct sometime this week i have no appetite due to the anxiety and cant eat more than maybe cals in a day its gotten so bad ive started having some suicidal ideation which is uncommon for me and that scares me so now im really wanting to get on a long term daily treatment but i am terrified of the increase in anxiety that these medications can cause when im already struggling with severe anxiousness as well as all the side effects in general i used to take sertraline zoloft years ago i was prescribed mgday and i remember that it eventually helped with my anxiety but the side effects were almost unbearable i was having daily migraines and i remember it did increase my anxiety in the beginning i ended up stopping because of the headaches and the withdrawals lasted a long time i also have mild experience with prozac about years ago i dont remember the dosage or much at all except i wasnt sleeping wellhaving crazy dreams and i was also getting auditory hallucinations so i stopped my therapist at the time attributed this to the combo of hydroxyzine and prozac but who knows i dont know what to do at this point im afraid of lexapro because of the qt prolongation i know basically all ssris can cause that but prozac and sertraline seem to have the lowest risk for those that have severe anxietyhealth anxiety and panic disorder what helped you the most i feel like im going crazy and i dont want to become dependent on the xanax tldr need ssri for panic disorder want to know if prozac or zoloft is best in terms of effectiveness and side effects or other medications recommended other than lexapro,1,0

my anxiety shot through the roof after i got sick with covid the first time in at christmas time after i got better from the actual sickness i had extreme panic attacks out of nowhere and for no reason at all this lasted for months i finally decided to go on zoloft mgnever increased after like months of pure mental torture it was a major help for me i was on it forhm a little over a year i think i decided to get off of it because i hate medicine and pills and i was doing fantastic so i didnt think i needed it anymore and it caused me to gain a lot of weight i think covid messed with my brain and how it functions it took years for me to get better and to feel normal again i now suffer from major health anxiety more specifically neurological disorders and heart disease anyway back to why i am posting i got really sick a month ago for weeks with that horrible respiratory flu thing going around but i suspect it was covid my anxiety spiked again the drowsiness dull headaches and brain fog never went away and i have developed a new symptomconstant whole body shaking it started a week ago from today out of nowhere and holy shit am i freaking out ive come to realize that anxiety body symptoms will disappear after some time and i keep telling myself that but damn am i terrified i have ms or some other neurological condition or a brain tumor symptoms i currently have going on for days now whole body internal vibrations whole body muscle tension and shakiness when moving skin crawling sensation sometimes insomnia and drowsiness dull headache all over my head major brain fogi cant think worth a damn you guys when i say whole body shakiness when i am at rest i dont shake at all its like i cantmake smooth motions with my body like say i reach for something my arm will shake a bit or if i flex my biceps my arms shake or if im holding a book or my phone my hand will tremor a bit it feels like my muscles have gotten a hard workout and are tired all over my body and not worse on either side its not hindering my movement at all and i have no weakness ive always had shakiness in my hands sometimes since i can remember but its after i was using my hands a lot at work or yard work or something ive also always had muscle twitches due to my scoliosis never thought anything of it but i woke up one morning feeling the vibrations again and noticed my movements were

a tldr at the bottom for some context i am an almost adult male and this past summer my parents divorced because my mom found out my dad had been cheating on her with multiple women throughout their whole marriage years on top of being an alcoholic and manipulator i tried therapy but i really just hate it i work out days a week but i only feel good during and for a small amount of time after working out im thinking about asking my mom to go see a doctor about medication but im too anxious to do that even though i know shed be open to it i have these constant thoughts that ive fucked everything up with my grades social life etc ill often get anxious about things like going to school talking to other people or going outside my comfort zone i know i am smart and capable but i just have this mental block where i cant get things done anymore along with that we moved states a couple years ago which i recently found out was because my dad was trying to cover up him cheating on my mom and all my best friends are still there who i talk to on a daily basis but i lack the physical presence because im miles away from them i think im a fairly nice and funny person but i feel like my anxiety is causing me to make friends here but not keep them ill make new friends and hang out with a group of people once or twice but cant keep them because im anxious to invite people to do things what led me to post this is that we went on vacation with some family friends this past week and it was the most happy ive felt in a long time i had people around me that i love and i knew that they love me too but as the trip came to an end they were talking about being ready to go home to their friends girlfriendboyfriend life all the things and i got this overwhelming sense of dread that i had nothing waiting for me at home no friends partners nothing at all and i feel worthless because of this it feels like this tightening thing in my chest what really hurts inside is that i have no one but family to talk to i need a deeper connection with someone but again i feel to anxious to reach out to new people im also a massive overthinker going thru all the scenarios in my head and often leading me to avoid things that i shouldnt have anxiety about i was also reading a letter today from one of my best friends from where i previously lived who made me all sorts of letters to read when im sad happy things like that in it she said that she hates when im sad or anxious because i get angry i feel like this opened my eyes to my behavior the past year or so ive been overly mean and will sometimesnot often lash out to people im closest with and care most about i feel like my anxious habits are turning my life upside down and making me someone i dont want to be tldr my parents recently divorced after my mom found out my dad had been cheating for years and he was also an alcoholic and manipulator ive tried therapy but didnt like it i work out regularly which helps temporarily but i still struggle with constant anxiety intrusive thoughts and feeling like ive messed up my life since moving states ive maintained longdistance friendships but struggle to form and keep new ones due to social anxiety a recent family trip made me realize how empty my life feels at home leaving me overwhelmed with loneliness and worthlessness im considering asking my mom about medication but anxiety holds me back i also worry my behavior has become mean or reactive toward loved ones because of my mental state im tired of feeling this way and dont want it to define me,1,2

thinking about death mortality and how we are our brains how we have bodies how there might be no spirit no point no point if you forget and lose everything youve ever had or done its insane i have never felt this way before i dont believe in the christian god but i naturally believe in a higher power the universe fate destiny that life is like a story that i will find a soulmate and always leaning towards reincarnation or something similar i have always perceived death as a stage not the end i have always felt at peace with it and connected to it somehow it was fine it was good when i was younger i used to have suicidal thoughts maybe not serious ones never was going to go through with it but i wasnt afraid to embrace death it felt like a step in life when i was even younger i had a few day period of thinking this person will die looking at anyone but it wasnt some sort of morbid fear it should be nothing new a few months ago i ended up in the hospital for a few days because of a mysterious chest pain i was sleep deprived overworked dehydrated i had symptoms of a heart attack no heart issues detected i got better after being released i genuinely spent those few days thinking id die i was convinced it was a possibility then the hospital advised me to get in therapy but i really didnt feel a need for it but it still didnt feel so alien then i was just upset that i led myself into not having enough time i was motivated to create be kind and live even better i wasnt scared of the after i just felt that i need more time i am an artist and i have always believed in souls and meaning i was happy just to live and i cherish my moments a few days ago i woke up very early before a test and this just popped up in my head like someone turned a switch all those thoughts that we are animals that there is no meaning i dont even doubt animals have souls that everything has a soul i dont know its driving me insane and even when i accepted everything in my head i realized this might not be a fear of death at all i just think i became hyperaware of my consciousness and started losing my sense of identity i know its temporary i get weird anxious thoughts every few months or years that bug me for a few days like this about anything but it just feels so bad its like stressful derealization i want to be normal again i am still a kid i am not even actively or rationally worrying its just like something in the back of my head a fear of fear a fear of fearing this for any longer this is the first time in my life i feel like its something that is challenging to get through by myself for the first time i feel like i need therapy or medication usually i can distance myself from any trouble by engaging with something else and can bend my mind to my will with ease i spent the whole weekend depressed scrolling through tiktok i havent touched it for a year in my bed trying to remember how to live again through the nonsense i watch i feel like a ghost jealous of other people for being alive as if i am the only person aware of death as if i forgot how to live without thinking about this i even woke up in the middle of the night the thoughts in my subconscious before i could even think of them myself normally i feel bad wasting any time doing nothing or consuming content instead of creating this weekend i have no regrets i just want it to stop its not even a conscious fear at this point its like i unlocked something i immediately feel better and distanced from those thoughts after writing it down but i think its a very brief addiction to reassurance i want to be stressed about life the feeling is like disgust its so disgusting and repulsive to have my mind tainted like this,2,6

hes great father ive made big mistake even mocked bedroombased lifestyle dont many friends struggle work due autism alone tells everything need know little cares nanna isnt much better constantly

relief i wanted to share my experience and see if anyone else has dealt with similar family dynamics my dad has always been selfentitled narcissistic and completely lacking in empathynot just towards me but towards everyone around him after separating from my mum he barely contributed financially to my upbringing saying it wasnt his responsibility because i had my stepdad and mum to support me at most hed throw my mum the occasional a week if that as i got older he refused to do anything with me outside of the steam room and sauna at the local leisure centrebecause it only cost him to get in wed sit in there barely able to talk with people around stay for less than an hour and then hed take me straight home that was the extent of our time together he also owes me money for my st birthday he promised me for my savings but only ever gave me just over since then hes kept making excuses always claiming he cant afford to pay me back yet despite spending thousands on getting his kitchen done up and buying a brandnew van meanwhile when my stepsister needed money he gave her the full immediately because she was in a time of need he has since significantly lowered the amount he says he owes me making out hes paid me more than what he already has and says its extra interest too which is a load of rubbish beyond that his behaviour is unbearable he completely dominates conversations and refuses to let anyone else speak one time at my nannas house he spoke for over an hour and a quarter straight and when my grandad tried to change the subject my dad lost itshouting at both of them to fuck off before storming out hes done this multiple times and never apologises always twisting situations so hes never at fault he also just doesnt engage for years whenever ive spoken to him he zones out giving vague yeah responses in a spacedout state clearly not even taking in what im saying there are often long silences before he even acknowledges ive spoken conversations with him feel completely onesided when i was struggling with my mental health in and really needed support he promised to see me more and be there for mebut like always it never happened i recently decided to block him and my nanna because i know from experience that reasoning with them is impossible any attempt would just be met with defensiveness anger or guilttripping instead i sent my dad a short message saying i needed space then blocked him again his response he messaged my mum claiming hes been a great father and that ive made a big mistake he even mocked me for having a bedroombased lifestyle because i dont have many friends and struggle with work due to my autism that alone tells me everything i need to know about how little he cares my nanna isnt much better she constantly invalidates my struggles especially with work dismissing them with everyone struggles you just have to push through it instead of actually trying to understand my challenges as an autistic person she recently brought up my disability benefits falsely claiming they might get taken away as if trying to pressure me into fulltime work whether i can cope or not conversations with her are exhaustingshe talks at me for minutes straight and i barely get a few words in neither of them are people i can reason with they dont listen they dont change and they dont respect my perspective blocking them was the only option left has anyone else dealt with family like this how did you handle it,2,1

yet keeps happening met two friends b training program nice supportive together started seeing things place didnt like point complaining wasnt given space opinions would ask advice friend friend would essentially get told many words hard dealing mental health stopped talking three days ago sent message saying damage things spread never thats b comes situation met b used also friend also cut toxic behavior b agreement felt upset actions week reached b told started talking around time dynamic b started change b always open shared problems one another friends helped things meltdowns well day b told drained teachers also thought draining around neither things ever said b teachers several month period confused asked b true said yes also proceeded call meltdowns fits really made upset didnt show really got apologized several times said sorry ever anything upset wasnt fair ever anything make feel like putting problems ahead good friend forgiven b said b tends call every day lately dont answer get upset time hospital couldnt drive called check texted next day say thinking later week b upset things family days alone really hurt fault family obligations traditions friend alone side tried reach every way able days volunteer event id telling b event month beforehand call im event cant answer text back say hey im eventname response age freaking years old would answered volunteering im scared talk b next time call feel like bad friend dont know im wondering talking b changed things also dont feel comfortable asking b know toxic person honestly wouldnt surprise theyre trying get back using b also suspect b keep calling pattern almost every day wouldnt problem still felt like friends id anything friends bs comments draining consistently followed jabs home life saying least support act like life bad response venting friend controlling situation financial abuse home dont know continue friendship get distance group want caring friend dont know feels like im expected give everything nearly every day without room speak emotions im also struggling feels like daily demand call autism controlling home life makes easier text throughout day im taking space forced deal issues anyone advice id grateful im sorry long post,how to handle a friend group that feels toxic im sorry for the new account its a throwaway so irls cant track me im also very sorry that this is long theres a lot of context thats happened i have autism and adhd and a history of being taken advantage of by people i know this and yet it keeps happening i met these two friends a and b in a training program a was nice and supportive when we were there together until they started seeing things about the place that they didnt like at that point it was all complaining and i wasnt given space to have my own opinions when i would ask for advice friend to friend i would essentially get an i told you so in so many words that was hard when i was dealing with my mental health too so i stopped talking to a about three days ago a sent me a message saying i did some damage with things i spread about them which i never did thats where b comes in same situation of where we met b used to also be as friend but also cut a off for toxic behavior b and i were in agreement on this and both felt upset by as actions about a week before a reached out to me b told me that they had started talking to a again this is around the same time that my dynamic with b started to change b and i have always been open and shared our problems with one another as friends i helped them through some things and they were there for me when i had meltdowns well on this day b told me that i drained them and that our teachers also thought i was draining to be around neither of these things had ever been said before by b or the teachers over a several month period so i was confused i asked b if that was true and they said yes they also proceeded to call my meltdowns fits which really made me upset i didnt show it but that really got to me i apologized several times and said that i was sorry if i ever did anything to upset them and that it wasnt fair to them if i ever did anything to make them feel like i was putting my problems ahead of being a good friend all was forgiven or so b said b tends to call me every day and lately if i dont answer they get upset there was a time where they were in the hospital and i couldnt drive to be there but i called to check in and texted the next day to say that i was thinking of them later that week b was upset with me that i had been doing things with my family during the days after when they had had to be alone it really hurt me because its not my fault that i had family obligations and traditions or that my friend had to be alone and on my side i had tried to reach out in every way that i was able to a few days after that i was at a volunteer event id been telling b about this event for a month or so beforehand they call while im at the event and i cant answer i text them back and say hey im at eventname their response was your my age freaking years old why would you be there i answered that i was volunteering now im scared to talk to b the next time that they call and i feel like a bad friend for that too i dont know what to do im wondering if a talking to b again has changed things but i also dont feel comfortable asking b about that i know a is a toxic person so it honestly wouldnt surprise me if theyre trying to get back at me by using b i also suspect that b will keep calling me because they have a pattern of doing it almost every day this wouldnt be a problem if i still felt like we were friends id do anything for my friends but bs comments about me being draining have been consistently followed with jabs at my home life saying that at least i have support and i act like my life is so bad when its not this is in response to me venting as a friend about the controlling situation financial abuse i am in at home i dont know how to continue with the friendship or how to get distance from this group i want to be a caring friend but i dont know how to be when it feels like im expected to give everything nearly every day without having any room to speak about my own emotions im also struggling with what feels like a daily demand to call when my autism and my controlling home life makes it easier for me to text throughout the day when im not taking some space or being forced to deal with other issues if anyone has advice id be so grateful im so sorry for the long post,1,1

mind examples one type offense one single band short span time even disengage entirely know stop emotional dysregulation around theres another band loved even band fully cut series devastating events havent listened single song years muted members socials try avoid content online hasnt fixed still think every day still cry probably every couple months still tattoo still fundamentally impact consume music art still long know miss without doubt single worst grief ever experienced cutting didnt fix whats point cutting band never worked band b band light life theyre identity theyre think talk news members marriage woman hate dropped one friends sent condolences bc often complain embarrassing think public relationships even course idea badly wrecked bc cant tell sorry rambling dont know nearstranger getting married complete stranger might completely changed life worse tldr sometimes experience unimaginable grief stranger somewhere got married left band certified cbt practices tarot idea stop cope even autistic thing single person feels way anything please dont reccommend therapy obviously meds tms journaling ill really take input want able enjoy things without constantly feeling like life drained bc stranger something dislike,is anyone else devastated when theyre special interest does something they dont like want to preface this by saying i am selfdiagnosed because i cant for the life of me find a neuropsychiatrist so im asking for advice as well as asking if this is even an autistic trait i always see people talking about how happy their special interest makes them and while i can relate to that but i feel like i never see anyone talking about how deeply upset their special interests also make them and im genuinely at a loss and want to know if its just me i deal with a lot emotional dysregulation and black white thinking which often means that i get extremely upset over things that i think are bad even knowing that its shit no one else cares about for example i fucking hate drugs religion sex romance therapy all things that are a inescapable and b innocuous i know but that doesnt change how i feel about them this is all worsened like tenfold when its something concerning my special interests most of my special interests are bands which are unfortunately are made up of people and people do stuff i hate its getting to a point where i feel like my life is genuinely being ruined by how regularly and repeatedly devastated i am but at the same time i dont feel like im in a place where i can just disengage from my special interests bc theyre also my main source of joy a recent example is a few weeks ago a member of my favorite band popped out with a wedding band i didnt even know he was dating anyone which is fine bc i know its not my business even though i make knowing about him my business despite the fact that i know theres nothing wrong with getting married i experienced the worst anxiety attack of my life for hours i was shaking anxious and could feel my blood rushing in my body i couldnt sleep because the feeling of my bed pressing against my skin was too uncomfortable and because my chest hurt so much i was afraid that my life was over and id never be able to enjoy my favorite band again theyre my favorite band the highlight of my day everyday and the closest thing i have to a hobby losing them like ive lost other favorite bands is my biggest fear i ended up just returning to status quo because i dont really have any control over how i feel about things i know it sounds insane as a mids woman to say that a man i dont know getting married knocked the wind out of me obviously i know i sound like a yr old one direction fan in but the point is not that i wish it couldve been mean the point is that someone i love did something evil and awful and i had no warning and there was nothing i could do about it before i could recover from that surprise another member of the band is married to a partner i knew he had but also absolutely hate so im not blindsided but this might be worse this news only broke like a day ago but it ruined what was supposed to be an extremely important and good day for me i was spending it engaging w one of my few interests that isnt a band lol my reaction to this was not as bad physically but i feel like somethings broken in me for the first time literally ever i saw that this member posted on his story and i didnt view it i turned off all the members notifications i set them on do not play on spotify i can not overstate how much i truly love this band and its members and its music but i feel like im at my wits end mind you these examples are just one type of offense from one single band over a short span of time and even if i disengage from them entirely i know that that will not stop my emotional dysregulation around them theres another band that i loved even before band a that i fully cut myself off from after a series of devastating events i havent listened a single song from them in years i muted the members on socials i try to avoid content about them online but that hasnt fixed me i still think about them every day i still cry about them probably every couple months i still have my tattoo for them they still have a fundamentally impact on how i consume music and art i still long to know about them i miss them its without a doubt the single worst grief i have ever experienced cutting myself off from them didnt fix that so whats the point in cutting myself off from band a if it never worked for band b band a is the light of my life theyre my identity theyre all i think about and talk about when the news of the members marriage to that woman i hate dropped one of my friends sent me condolences bc i often complain about how embarrassing i think public relationships are but even they of course have no idea how badly this has wrecked me bc i cant tell them that sorry for rambling i just dont know what to do this nearstranger getting married to a complete stranger might have completely changed my life for the worse tldr sometimes i experience unimaginable grief because some stranger somewhere got married or left a band or is certified in cbt or practices tarot and i have no idea how to stop it or how to cope is this even an autistic thing is there a single other person who feels this way is there anything i can do about it please dont reccommend therapy obviously or meds or tms or journaling but ill really take any input at all because i just want to be able to enjoy things without constantly feeling like the life is being drained out of me bc a stranger did something i dislike,0,6

long thing but ill cut to the chase foot infection seen by gps er doc dermatologist infectious disease and podiatrist everyone concerned and validating the foot infection weeks of oral antibiotics a few days in hospital for iv antibiotics that im allergic to infection contained but not resolved go off antibiotics weeks on so that we can see what happens you might know where this is going i start to become convinced that there is something foreign in my foot my symptoms are evolving every day and i start to have ummm sensations especially at night the infection is visibly shifting around i start to try out saying first to partner bestie parent hey im starting to think theres something living in my foot people are being affirming that thats a possibility get back in w infectious disease i explain my concern i show them visually my concern they look at my chart and essentially say have you spoken with your psychiatrist about your concern that there is something living in your foot would you like us to call him they then assure me that im healing from the mystery infection of the last month and a half and that the visual signs ive identified are venous healing that my veins and capillaries were damaged by the infection and this is just them being angry and healing i point out that my veins are moving every day they send me away symptoms gets worse see another gp a week later i say theres something living in my foot i show him progress pics he checks my file and notes that infectious disease put in that i was unhappy and upset with their care and that they advised connecting with my psychiatrist who is away on an extended vacation i insist there is something in my foot he shows care but also suggests connecting with my psychiatrist these hcps werent suggesting connecting with my shrink bc i was being combative or appearing mentally ill but because being pretty sure there is something foreign to you living in you is classic bipolar delusion gentle reader as im sure you are now aware there was a goddam nest of larvae living in my foot growing into worms a nest of worms for months which is horrifying and im dealing with it but the reason im putting it here is because ive had a bipolar diagnosis for yrs i am lucky and usually have good mental health care im on good meds im mostly stable i havent had a major episode since i have a family a full time job a mortgage and the trappings of a good life i do all the right sleep right sobriety right activity pieces all it took was instance of an atypically presenting illness to allow almost every hcp i encountered in this mess to write off my concerns as being a product of essentially psychosis and admittedly i spent some of that time wondering if i was experiencing delusion bc all the providers assured me that i was experiencing delusion as more doctors told me that there couldnt possibly be something living in my foot although everyone agreed that there was certainly something wrong with my foot even my partner parents and friends started to tell me that maybe it was delusion id always heard that a diagnosis of mental illness makes it easier for other health care providers to pigeonhole your concerns but id never experienced it but this was a perfect storm and now i know humbling and infuriating my and my worms are off to drink some more poison now wish us luck well wish me luck wish them dead thanks for coming to my ted talk on the hazards of a bipolar person walking into a hospital and saying theres something foreign living inside of me,10,5

trip gon na go feel like im going want stay hotel remainder trip still week left sucks ive spent much savings coming obviously really regret starting know stupid mood instability normally bad begin diagnosed bp teen largely went unmedicated depression time low past months decided try meds feel even worse took someone bp wouldnt say experience much mania maybe dont tend notice much depressive episodes feel uninterested everything everyone also extremely irritable pessimistic self esteem self worth also really low blame absolutely everything cant stand way anymore also cant handle skin problems dealt bad acne rosacea teen affects self esteem lot also lamictal seems cause constipation huge issue well since ive struggled past taken years regulate digestive system anyone recommend medications think might help along always leaned towards lamictal due causing weight gain seemingly least side effects unfortunately case psychiatrist mentioned lithium ive always skeptical reason lithium cause similar symptoms better option someone recommend ps thank much guys reading know really long genuinely needed advice since im alone im able contact psychiatrist time please try judge im really experienced comes medication im still learning ty,lamictal advice hey you all so almost weeks ago i started taking lamotrigine mg very low dose it started out pretty amazing actually my mood instantly improved and i felt so upbeat and happy i went on vacation on march th for weeks so im currently out of the country i initially thought it might not be a good idea to start it right before i go but the psychiatrist that prescribed it to me said she would have a follow up shortly after i return so i thought itd be better to be on it for while to report back to her days ago i started having like a rosacea outbreak and acne all over my face i normally have rosacea but this is a severe flare up which i normally never have especially with acne im sure its due to the lamictal because when i was on it several years ago i experienced break outs as well havent been feeling sick though and i dont think its sjs as it just looks like a sunburn all over my face with spots i stopped the mg dose yesterday and my redness actually immediately improved lol but today i was so incredibly depressed i feel like i didnt even care about seeing any sights anymore and i just felt so uninterested about everything around me it made me really sad because i was so energetic and excited my first few days here im on a trip to europe for the first time and i was just wandering around about to burst into tears i know that its understandable to be upset about the skin rash and not being able to take the meds i thought were working for me but i was irrationally very sad and upset like almost suicidal i also started to get panicky as well like i just had a very bad and scary feeling i wasnt sure what i was supposed to do and i was so worried about everything and if i would mess up my trip etc i had to go back to my hotel to calm down and i just cried i started thinking that maybe suddenly stopping it from one day to another made my mood unusually erratic and unstable so when i got back i decided to just take half of the mg tablet literally a few hours later and my skin is now extremely flushed again im not sure if im allergic but clearly i cant even taper off it either im really worried about how the rest of my trip is gon na go and i feel like im just going to want to stay at my hotel for the remainder of my trip i still have a week left it just sucks because ive just spent so much of my savings on coming here obviously now i really regret starting it when i did and i know it was stupid my mood instability is normally bad to begin with i have been diagnosed with bp as a teen and i largely went unmedicated for my s my depression has just been at an all time low these past few months and i decided to try meds again now i feel even worse than i did before i took it as someone with bp i wouldnt say i experience too much mania or maybe if i do i dont tend to notice it as much as the depressive episodes i just feel uninterested in everything and everyone and also extremely irritable and pessimistic my self esteem and self worth is also really low and i blame myself for absolutely everything i cant stand being this way anymore but i also cant handle the skin problems i dealt with bad acne and rosacea as a teen and this affects my self esteem a lot also the lamictal seems to cause constipation which is a huge issue for me as well since ive struggled with that in the past too and its taken me years to regulate my digestive system can anyone recommend any medications they think might help me along i always leaned towards lamictal due to it not causing any weight gain and seemingly having the least side effects but unfortunately not in my case my psychiatrist mentioned lithium but ive always been skeptical about it for some reason does lithium cause similar symptoms or is there a better option someone can recommend ps thank you so much guys for reading i know that was really long but i genuinely just needed advice since im out here alone and im not able to contact my psychiatrist at this time please try not to judge me as im really not that experienced when its comes to medication and im still learning ty again,1,2

towards se sh seem like dysphoric mania youre partner support also protecting wellbeing thank much able help lot deal id really appreciate support insight,trigger warning sh question im placing a trigger warning here that this question involves sh by my partner and im trying to understand what the hell is going on im scared and worried and exhausted my partner likely has pmdd but bd traits are seemingly starting to emerge that makes it seem like pme might be more accurate for them im currently recognised as their carer after an episode of sh last week i wanted to come here to ask about what others know because i am so lost and worried and scared basically im going to give details of the incident below tw i discovered my partner alone in a public park around pm last week because we follow each other on life and they were in luteal with depressive symptoms after a suicide attempt the month prior due to an ssri toxicity or inducing bd as i walked up to them they had their arms by their sides and were holding a small box cutter they had a completely blank expression on their face as i got even close in the darkness i noticed evidence of many lacerations and blood i later found out that they had been trying to set their clothes on fire at first they said they did not know why they did this but later realised it was because it helped them to not feel numb and to feel anything to me this does not seem like standard pmdd stuff and their psychiatrist pointed out it seemed like they were experiencing mania which lead me to investigate bd and realise they seemed to have a lot of the symptoms they also chain smoked a pack of cigarettes theyre not a smoker and the butts were littered around them their affect was completely flat this was extremely traumatic to witness especially after their attempt the month before i went blank and was confused about what i was seeing then it hit me and i went into a full blown panic attack i called emergency services the police came i called my partners medical team to get things sorted out i advocated for my partners need for inpatient care to the hospital psychiatrist they were admitted a couple of days later today they seemed to be in a massive rage episode becoming very very angry after i had expressed calmly but assertively needs for follow through yesterday after they had stabilized this week before last weeks sh incident they had been extremely tired for days and did not want to talk at all and i mean at all they also started texting in a weird way with weird punctuation and grammar which is unlike them they were extremely ragefilled and opted to sleep in their car instead of home for the two nights before their sh episode this is not normal for them outside of luteal or perhaps what i now think could be a mixed episode the hospital psychiatrist has defined them as having a high risk for suicide we are deathly afraid that this may happen to my partner again the psychiatrist has prescribed an antipsychotic as well which i am curious about the toxicity reaction from last month involving a stimulant and ssri had much in common with mania or mixed episode they had been agitated and speaking fast for a few days they had been very productive they had been irritable and rage filled they had felt overwhelmed they had started seeing visual perceptive disturbances graphicviolent hallucinations and eventually had in feeling very numb and depressed and guilty and angry been very close to taking their life but thank god a passerby stopped them i am so terrified for what this means i care about my partner i love them but they can be emotionally abusive in these episodes and i am very fatigued and exhausted at the same time i want to support them and understand more about what theyre going through this is long so thank you if you got this far my question i suppose is do any of these events ring true for you does anyone else experience these kind of intrusive thoughts and urges towards se or sh does this seem like dysphoric mania if youre a partner how do you support while also protecting your own wellbeing thank you so much if you are able to help its a lot to deal with and id really appreciate the support and insight,0,1

embarrassing contacted family multiple times ers saying love life genuinely also tmi despite issues limbido sky high right like wtf case previous insomnia episode nd cousin sure matters late bipolar hes done things try book flight africa uk save someone self harm attempted jump bridges multiple times get depressed ive tried bipolar immediate family substantial amount anxiety depression got twothree relatives autism im put anti anxiety meds soon dont know bring idea antipsychotics point im losing looking diagnosis im sort wondering mania looked like past appreciate insight,anyone deal with ocd and bipolar together getting it ruled out soon hey all i m have struggled with anxiety and ocd since it started out as a night insomnia episode by the time it was over i thought i was dying or that my deceased friend was haunting me the ocd diagnosis came a year later and over the years ive battled a lot of really messed up themes im not in therapy or on meds while my ocd is constant it was pretty under control last year that has changed since the summer i got really latched on to the idea of getting rabies it started when i was walking at dusk and something grazed my leg now ive gone to the er more times than i can count since august for issues ranging from rabies brain eating amoebas and meningitis i owe thousands lol the worst began midjanuary i was unemployed staying up extremely late and was depressed i was also going through a ocd scare questioning if my vaccinated dog had rabies she doesnt one night i slept for hours the following three days i didnt sleep at all went to the er with the assumption i was dying and begged for a valium or ivs to put me under i pissed the doctor off asking an absurd amount of questions about rabies i got given hydroxyzine for two weeks i got hours of sleep i had hypnic jerks talked in my sleep sleep paralysis and vivid dreams my doctor upped me to diazepam which i never filled for because my sleep returned to normal nothing in my habits changed it just gradually went back to normal a week ago i went to the er again for a sudden breathing difficulties for the life of me i could not take a deep breath blood work was fine but i discovered im prediabetic and have high blood pressure the doctor tried to explain that besides dropping a few pounds for the diabetes im psychically healthy but referred me to psychiatry my parents think im on drugs since leaving the hospital my sleep is bad again while my shortness of breath has improved i keep waking up with adrenaline at am and have developed twitching in my left arm currently i have not slept in hours and feel another freakout coming on im terrified im dying and am booking an mri and emg tbh i have no idea if this is mania right now im incredibly stressed out sleep deprived and am struggling to fight the belief im not dying when it comes to diseases and death its all very real to me this is embarrassing but i have contacted my family multiple times from ers saying i love them because to me my life is genuinely over also tmi but despite all of these issues my limbido is sky high right now which has me like wtf this was the same case with the previous insomnia episode i have a nd cousin not sure if this matters in his late s who is bipolar hes done things such as try to book a flight to africa from the uk to save someone self harm and has attempted to jump off bridges multiple times i get depressed but ive not tried any of this no bipolar in my immediate family but there is a substantial amount of anxiety depression and i got twothree relatives with autism im being put on anti anxiety meds soon but i dont know if i should bring up the idea of antipsychotics at this point because im losing it not looking for a diagnosis at all but im sort of wondering what mania has looked like for you all in the past appreciate any insight,3,12

irritable way overstimulated always edge wasnt really identifying sort mania mixed episode went full swing autoimmune disease called graves disease causes hyperthyroidism also adhd im finding conundrum trying fix one thing without affecting example im methimazole graves people said causes insulin issues believe first time ever fasted glucose ac ran higher ever werent concerned pcp endocrinologist even though overweight know various bp meds also cause insulin problems ive oxcarbazepine well always felt like made retain lot water possibly even gain little weight along feeling cross eyed hours every pill took days mixed episode desperate figure stop seemed work part symptoms got searching water retention related med thats found whole low sodium thing already water retention methimazole regularly take diuretics im little concerned want maybe try carbamazepine due others saying tends work better ive seen metabolize meds faster cant find info methimazole believe says affect beta blockers ive heart rate due graves increased er mg dose try help anxiety think making also gain weight possibly low making heart rate maybe wont work anymore cant take many benzos meds considered downers vyvanse record vyvanse never affected heart rate blood pressure nothing ive checked mainly force supply issues ive since dont take feel worse root cause emotions ive dealing week mixed episode went weekend without vyvanse still wasnt right headspace cant handle weight gain cant handle normal headspace affecting whole life due mixed episodes regardless duration severity cant thyroid whack im already overweight close prediabetic risk crossing territory think mixed episodes addressed anxiety subside dont need higher dose propranolol never bad irritability mixed emotions started forever ago point screwed need find new endocrinologist experience belt try help navigate insulin resistance literally one biggest conditions treat dont understand lack concern need help im tired playing doctor doctor psych see next week see happens thanks reading made far insight helpful,what have you done if your meds make you prediabetic andor worsen other conditions you have long story short i am type been on lamotrigine for a very long time i had my first ever pretty bad mixed episode about a week ago after months and months of feeling more reactive in an irritable way overstimulated just always on edge i wasnt really identifying this as any sort of mania until the mixed episode went full swing i have an autoimmune disease called graves disease that causes hyperthyroidism and also adhd im finding myself in this conundrum trying to fix one thing without affecting the other for example im on methimazole for the graves and people have said it causes insulin issues i believe it because for the first time ever my fasted glucose was so i had my ac ran and it was which is higher than its ever been they werent concerned at all the pcp or endocrinologist even though i am overweight too i know there are various bp meds that can also cause insulin problems ive been on and off of oxcarbazepine as well and always felt like it made me retain a lot of water and possibly even gain a little weight along with the feeling of being cross eyed for hours after every pill i took it a few days into the mixed episode desperate to figure out how to stop it and it seemed to work for the most part but once again those symptoms i got to searching for water retention related to this med and thats when i found the whole low sodium thing i already have water retention from the methimazole and i regularly take diuretics because of it im a little concerned so i want to maybe try carbamazepine due to others saying it tends to work better but ive seen it can metabolize some meds faster i cant find info on the methimazole but i believe it says it will affect beta blockers which ive been on for my heart rate due to the graves we just increased to an er mg dose to try and help with my anxiety i do think its making me also gain weight possibly because of how low its making my heart rate so that maybe wont work anymore i cant take many benzos and meds considered downers because of the vyvanse for the record the vyvanse has never affected my heart rate blood pressure nothing ive checked mainly by force from supply issues ive been on it since and when i dont take it i only feel worse so its not the root cause of any of these emotions ive been dealing with the week of that mixed episode i went all weekend without the vyvanse and still wasnt in my right headspace i cant handle the weight gain i cant handle being so out of a normal headspace that its affecting my whole life due to mixed episodes regardless of duration or severity i cant have my thyroid out of whack and im already overweight and too close to prediabetic to risk crossing over into that territory i think if the mixed episodes can be addressed then the anxiety will subside with it to where i dont need the higher dose of propranolol because it was never this bad until the irritability and mixed emotions started forever ago at what point am i just screwed i need to find a new endocrinologist that has more experience under their belt to try and help me navigate this insulin resistance is literally one of the biggest conditions they treat so i dont understand their lack of concern i need help and im tired of playing doctor because of that doctor my psych is doing all she can i see her next week so we will see what happens but thanks for reading if you made it this far any insight is helpful,6,32

spent together along feeling deeply ashamed went wrong know lot work anyway looking back years ive realized havent spent much time alone relationships even prioritizing mental health safety would required staying single im almost ive relationships varying levels commitment since ive single maybe years years symptoms triggers deeply rooted close relationships especially romantic partners im certain pattern added insult injury logical course action breakup sad take care eventually move im sure ever slowed enough realize actually needed break especially ever actually want experience happy healthy relationship chased fantasy falling true love loved protected eventually married kind hearted man little regard real personal needs responsibilities extremely limited understanding actually takes build nurture mature relationship years spent making friends finding experiencing new things spent time playing house devoting energy thought men human laser focus men neglected importance many things building selfconfidence going friends saving money way missed finding unknowingly albeit good intentions looked towards men fill gaps makes wonder symptoms would look longterm took serious break dating basically opposite would happen stopped dating meantime built strong healthy friendships nurtured connection family spent time things love got hands dirty therapy tried new things developed career would even place value romantic relationships imagine hope spending time therapy would better help understand needs well triggers boundaries turn aid making better decisions people care think learning truly love time may free cycle clinging strange men hurting process anybody relate serial monogamists lot yall spent lot time relationships taken breaks dating affect symptoms know us symptoms sort disappear single wonder really come back full force actually taking necessary time heal,wanting to improve longterm thinking about dating hiatus ive been a lurker here for a while for context a relatively short relationship that was very very dear to me ended a while ago ive been reflecting a lot and aside from grieving our relationship and reminiscing on the time we spent together along with feeling deeply ashamed about where i went wrong i know that i have a lot to work on anyway looking back over the years ive realized i havent spent much time alone between relationships even when prioritizing my mental health and safety would have required staying single im almost and ive been in relationships with varying levels of commitment since i was and ive only been single for maybe years out of those years my symptoms and triggers are deeply rooted in my close relationships especially my romantic partners and im certain that this pattern has only added insult to injury as the logical course of action after a breakup is to be sad for a while take care of yourself and eventually move on im not sure i ever slowed down enough to realize i actually needed a break especially if i ever did actually want to experience a happy healthy relationship i chased a fantasy of falling in true love and being loved and protected and eventually married to a kind hearted man with very little regard for my own very real personal needs and responsibilities and with an extremely limited understanding of what actually it takes to build and nurture a mature relationship in the years that i should have spent making friends finding myself and experiencing new things i spent most of my time playing house and devoting my energy and thought to men who were just as human as i was because of my laser focus on men i neglected the importance of so many things from building selfconfidence to going out with your friends to saving your own money in a way i missed out on finding myself and unknowingly albeit with good intentions looked towards men to fill the gaps all of this makes me wonder how my symptoms would look longterm if i took a serious break from dating and basically did the opposite of what i was doing what would happen if i stopped dating for a while and in the meantime built strong healthy friendships nurtured my connection with family spent time doing the things i love got my hands dirty in therapy tried new things and developed my career would i even place the same value on romantic relationships i imagine and hope that spending some time with myself and in therapy would better help me understand my own needs as well as my triggers and boundaries and in turn aid me in making better decisions for myself and the people in care about i think learning how to truly love myself on my own time may free me from the cycle of clinging to strange men and hurting them and myself in the process does anybody relate any serial monogamists have a lot of yall spent a lot of time in relationships or taken breaks from dating how did it affect your symptoms i know that for some of us our symptoms sort of disappear when were single but i do wonder if they really come back with full force when were actually taking the necessary time to heal,1,0

want like try manipulate thinking situation worse reality feel like want diagnoses like make feel validated feel like exaggerate im saying want special people pity time genuinely really feel like relate ton stuff concerning im also really worried shes gon na ask feels like upcoming test havent studied im trying know answer get think one way another im really curious kinda questions might brought whats common feel like ive kinda ruined chance believing though first sought help told depression said pretty much always felt like shit fear taking seriously told mood swings going content life hating every part time bpd didnt even cross mind thought faking depressed didnt hate living fear abandonment unstable mood things relate lot often feel like need withdraw people care love im terrified ones leave things impacting relationships everyone care ton really want help dont know worth going see psychologist really dont wan na waste anyones time im also scared able take seriously dont bring problems self harm suicide im terrified admitted ward something tell severe things also dont want dismiss completely dont bring really dont know wan na ask get angry mood swings bpd definitely feel like intense ones smallest stuff rarely get mad im irritated say friend mine replies bit late tone expecting get super fucking sad think despise everything something minor almost never anger ive seen much conflicting information normal bpd id really appreciate someone knows could clarify dont know im even showing enough symptoms something talk though dont know cancel appointment please please help really stressing im really sorry tagged vent rather advice really dont know fits better,terribly scared of upcoming appointment vent kind of ive read a fair bit about bpd over the last couple months now after i first got curious about it and wanted to learn more and the more research i do about it the more i can relate to it and the more scared i get that i might have it i brought it up briefly to my psychiatrist that i was concered about it last time i saw her but i dont feel like she took me seriously at all and kinda just laughed it off im diagnosed with autism adhd and persistent depressive disorder and she said that its likely just my adhd that makes me impulsive and emotionally unstable but from what ive read adhd impulsivity doesnt feel like it fits what im experiencing at all however she did set up an appointment for me to talk about bpd with the same lady who diagnosed me with my autism and adhd im so terribly nervous about it though because im really scared she will think im just faking all my symptoms or that ill accidentally want to like try to manipulate her into thinking my situation is worse than what it in reality is i feel like i want to have diagnoses like these because they make me feel validated for once and because of that i feel like i exaggerate what im saying just because i want to be special and have people pity me but at the same time i genuinely really feel like i can relate to a ton of stuff concerning it im also just really worried about what shes gon na ask me it feels like i have an upcoming test i havent studied for im not trying to know what i should answer to get her to think one way or another about me but im really curious about what kinda questions might be brought up and whats common i feel like ive kinda ruined any chance of them believing me though when i first sought help and told them about my depression i said that i pretty much always felt like shit but i did that out of fear of them not taking me seriously if i told them i had mood swings going from being content with life to hating every part of it at the time bpd didnt even cross my mind i thought i was just faking being depressed because i didnt hate living the fear of abandonment and unstable mood are things i relate to a lot i often feel like i need to withdraw myself from people i care for and love just because im terrified of them being the ones to leave me both of these things are impacting my relationships with everyone i care about a ton and i really want help with it but i dont know if its worth going to see the psychologist for i really dont wan na waste anyones time im also so scared about her not being able to take me seriously if i dont bring up my problems with self harm and suicide im terrified of being admitted to a ward or something if i tell her about how severe these things are but i also dont want her to dismiss me completely if i dont bring it up and i really dont know what to do and i wan na ask do you have to get angry mood swings if you have bpd i definitely feel like i have very intense ones over the smallest stuff but i very rarely get mad over it at most im irritated but say if a friend of mine replies a bit late or not in the tone i was expecting i get super fucking sad and think they despise everything about me just because something as minor as that but its almost never anger ive seen so much conflicting information on if this is normal when you have bpd or not and id really appreciate if someone who knows more than me could clarify i dont know if im even showing

describe sweet things going well told early bpd never judgement although didnt get detail affects ive n issues drinking past couple years dont drink every day go limit often caused split reckless impulsive ruin relationships however saturday night probably worst something ive never done best day ever boyfriend started drinking early running couple hours sleep everything day perfect later night working bar friend bar next door ended blacking point dont even remember following details apparently sitting random guys lap kissing heavily flirting hours bfs friends saw everything told genuinely recollection even worse bc cant explain happened bpd drinking excuse take full accountability actions dont know reckless selfish behavior hate hurt like feel disgusted absolutely nothing deserve feel worse bc ive side know feels seem ruin every good thing life ive burned bridges count start couldve healthiest relationship ive ever thought alone long enough face put work able relationship clearly havent done enough hate destructive put thru amount pain hurt others along way something live especially nothing good im embarrassed happened went bar works n passed spilling drink process move upstairs couch could sleep rest shift woke learned everything went home started talk even still way nice patient couldnt believe hearing mental breakdown crying hysterically point panic attack hyperventilating started splitting bad grabbed sharpest object could find happened screwdriver n started cutting leg walked know scared never seen state felt worse bc console hurt ive splitting since sunday morning voluntarily left house bc said needs time process everything talk made sound like doesnt want throw away would like work things honestly dont know things play everything hits im terrible person always questioned ppl past make villain see actually evil always reluctant meet new ppl bc always end another bridge burn one way another almost better alone cant hurt anyone sucks bc truly feel like good intentions go self destruct reason even chooses forgive continue relationship never forgive friends hold sucks bc felt like clean slate mutual friends everyone hes introduced new face felt nice experience well ive left quite impression little less months relationship hes ever done speak highly treat respect shown love ive never felt im ashamed want punish n hurting would give drinking th time meant would never hurt bc absolutely would done sober even little less drunk cant explain regardless theres nothing could say justify shitty behavior,im a terrible person ive been dating this guy for about months now and hes been nothing less than perfect he treats me so well and goes out of his way to do nice things for me literally treated me better in these past several weeks than any guy has ever treated me i cant even begin to describe how sweet he is things were going so well i told him early on about my bpd there was never any judgement although i didnt get too into detail about what it is and how it affects me ive had off n on issues with drinking for the past couple years now i dont drink every day but when i do i go over my limit more often than not which has caused me to split be reckless and impulsive and ruin relationships before however what i did saturday night is probably the worst and is something ive never done before i had just had the best day ever with my boyfriend i started drinking early and was running off only a couple hours of sleep but everything about the day was perfect later that night he was working at the bar i was with a friend at the bar next door and ended up blacking out to the point where i dont even remember any of the following details but apparently i was sitting in this random guys lap and kissing him and heavily flirting for hours my bfs friends saw everything and told him i genuinely do not have any recollection of this which is even worse bc i cant explain how or why it happened my bpd and drinking is not an excuse i take full accountability for my actions but i dont know how i can be so reckless and selfish with my behavior i hate that i hurt him like i feel disgusted with myself he did absolutely nothing to deserve this and i feel worse bc ive been on the other side and i know how it feels so why did i do it why do i seem to ruin every good thing in my life ive burned more bridges than i can count this was the start of what couldve been the most healthiest relationship ive ever been in i thought i had been alone long enough before to face myself and put in the work to be able to be in a relationship again but i clearly havent done enough i hate how destructive i am i will put myself thru any amount of pain but to hurt others along the way is something i can not live with especially those who have been nothing but good to me im so embarrassed after this happened i went to the bar he works at n passed out spilling my drink in the process he had to move me upstairs to a couch so i could sleep the rest of his shift when i woke up he had learned about everything we went home and started to talk to me about it even still being way too nice and patient with me i couldnt believe what i was hearing i had a mental breakdown was crying hysterically to the point i had a panic attack and was hyperventilating and started splitting so bad on myself that i grabbed the sharpest object i could find which happened to be a screwdriver n started cutting my leg he walked in on me doing this and i know it scared him he had never seen me in this state before then i felt worse bc he was having to console me when it was him who i hurt ive been splitting on myself since sunday morning i voluntarily left his house bc he said he needs time to process everything before we talk again he made it sound like he doesnt want to throw what we have away and would like to work things out but i honestly dont know how things will play out once everything hits him im a terrible person i always questioned why ppl from my past make me out to be a villain but i see now that i actually am evil i have always been reluctant to meet new ppl bc they always end up being another bridge that i burn one way or another its almost better for me to be alone so i cant hurt anyone it sucks bc i truly do feel like i have good intentions but then i go and self destruct for no reason even if he chooses to forgive me and continue our relationship i will never forgive myself for this his friends will hold this against me too which sucks bc i felt like i had a clean slate we had no mutual friends so everyone hes introduced me to is a new face which felt nice to experience for once well ive left quite the impression and its only a little less than months into our relationship all hes ever done is speak highly of me to them and treat me with the most respect and shown me love that ive never felt before im so ashamed i want to punish myself over n over for hurting him i would give up drinking again for the th time if it meant that i would never hurt him again bc i absolutely would not have done this sober or even being just a little less drunk i just cant explain why i did that regardless theres nothing i could say to justify my shitty behavior,4,4

relationships honest without exposed dont give easy really fucking hard one else understand unless theyve life chaotic especially youre young youre going fuck say things youll regret youll lose people isnt something people bpd go life messy painful unpredictablefor everyone light end tunnel ones going drag walk thats makes beautiful,advice to young people with bpd i m have been in treatment for my mental health for years and was diagnosed with bpd years ago it has been a painful road to get to where i am but i no longer meet the criteria for bpd and havent for years lately ive been reflecting on what ive learned through all of this i think some of it might be helpful for anyone whos just been diagnosed or is starting treatment a few of these points may come off as blunt or harshbut id rather be honest and direct than sugarcoat things thats what i needed when i was starting out and maybe someone else does too the worst thing you can do is overidentify with this diagnosis this is not a disease like cancer or the flu there is no blood test or scan or universal biomarker bpd is a cluster of observed behaviors and emotional responses that meet a threshold set by diagnostic criteria it is better to view this diagnosis as a framework to address your problems rather than a fixed biological fact when you start seeing everything through the lens of bpdyour moods your actions your relationshipsyou trap yourself saying i did this because of my bpd doesnt make it okay it might explain it but it doesnt excuse it and if you keep leaning on the diagnosis like a crutch youll never learn to walk without it things improve over time but you get to decide the cost there are two paths forward and youre going to learn either way you get into treatmenttherapy dbt selfreflection whatever worksand actually do the work its hard its uncomfortable but its growth you learn to sit with your emotions take responsibility and break the patterns that keep wrecking your life you dont do the work you keep spiraling you keep lashing out you learn through painlosing people who loved you burning bridges you cant rebuild and missing out on opportunities you may never get again youll still improve over time but youll carry more scars selfawareness is paramount you have to be brutally honest with yourself about your behavior that means no lying to yourself about why you did something no sugarcoating no justifying yes it is uncomfortable to admit you did something out of desperation for attention a need for control or fear of being abandoned but if you dont recognize why you did it youll do it again break the cycle now while you still can the longer you avoid the truth the more damage you doand the more shame youll have to climb out of later be careful with who you let in theres a cost to being fully seen when youre strugglingespecially if it happens often or over a long period of time the hard truth is that people dont always forget what they saw you might move on you might growbut to them youre still the person who broke down spiraled lost control the more someone sees you as unstable the harder it becomes for them to see you as strong reliable or capable the perception can stickeven after youve done the work to change this doesnt mean you need to hide everything or fake being okay it does mean that you should be intentional about who you confide in not everyone deserves a frontrow seat to your struggles protect your dignity protect your future relationships you can be honest without being exposed dont give up this will not be easy its really fucking hard and no one else will understand unless theyve been through it themselves life is chaotic especially when youre young youre going to fuck up say and do things youll regret youll lose people but this isnt something only people with bpd go through this is life its messy painful and unpredictablefor everyone there is a light at the end of the tunnel but no ones going to drag you to it you have to walk there yourself but thats what makes it beautiful,433,35

tired deal relentless critical voice head,i think i was born evil i was raised by two devoted parents and later had two sweet younger siblings my father is easygoing and incredibly patient he has never been anything but gentle and kind to me my mother is extremely generous with her time and effort she is funny and bright and possesses the ability to make you feel like the most special person in the world with her praise she can be a bit overbearing and critical at times but she always put in a ridiculous amount of effort to make my life as wonderful as physically possible and was far more patient than a lot of mothers are our relationship has become strained over the years but i know that she still loves me very deeply we were wealthy and i never felt any sort of lack growing up i was naturally intelligent and talented and never struggled in school or to succeed at any of my passions i received a lot of praise from authority figures and got along relatively well with my peers until i got older i dont know why i am such a deeply flawed person i know that a lot of you would be thriving had you grown up in my shoes i have no idea how ive ended up with the same struggles as people who have been through extreme abuse and trauma i have no idea why im such a naturally weak person i can not remember a time when i havent hated myself it seems as though i was born insecure i started throwing tantrums at and though i express it differently now have been an angry person ever since i am cruel and vindictive with an explosive temper my mother claims that my anger has given her ptsd she hasnt been diagnosed but i do not doubt for a second that raising me has traumatized her my parents relationship has deteriorated over the years they were never that affectionate or loving but only started resenting each other once my anger issues began my youngest brother adored me as a child and mimics a lot of my negative behaviours i will never forgive myself for ruining what couldve been a perfect family the ridiculous thing is that none of my relatives have any mental health issues at all how is it possible that ive ended up so awful i am impulsive and require constant distractions to exist without feeling bored to the point of being suicidal i am incapable of showing affection to anyone unless they want nothing to do with me i am conventionally attractive but feel so ugly that i want to die and make it everybody elses problem ive always wanted to be good but am naturally horrible at being anything other than a liability i am still mean and am still vindictive and lose all my empathy whenever i feel betrayed i have major abandonment issues and am always quick to reject others in fear of being rejected myself i have absolutely no reason to behave the way that i do i have absolutely no excuses i have been in therapy since i was and have been on medication since around that time as well i am continually getting worse and feel absolutely helpless in stopping it please tell me if you are able to relate or can provide any insight as to why i am the way i am i feel like the worst person to ever exist and while i certainly dont wish to have had a less idyllic childhood hate that i cant point to anything that made me this way i dont think ill ever be able to live without being burdened with ridiculous amounts of guilt and am not entirely sure

what do i do hi im years old turning within the next month and i feel like im not going anywhere with my life and having suicidal thoughts i wont go too deep into that specifically which is why i use the emotional advice flair i really hope someone will be interested enough to read this and to give me genuine advice i have done years of therapy i have been diagnosed with bpd when i was a lot has changed and i have been content with the person i am for a long time now but still i get very insecure and feel like nobody genuine likes me or cares much what even is the solution to feeling intense emotions besides just not expressing them to others i was born and raised in small places in the europe i dont come from a good home and was mentally and physically abused growing up until by my stepdad so was my mom by him they broke up when i was she is very loving but also very naive and never is able to help me financially i moved out at our relationship is good currently and has mostly been but i often feel not cared about by anyone i have not had close friends for almost years and i was in intense and toxic relationships for the past almost years i often dont know what im still doing this for i feel like i am never satisfied when i do have good things or that they dont last my biggest interest is d animation and d printing i get small jobs and good things out of it its the best thing that happened for me learning blender i have been for almost years but sometimes i take months of breaks and never get serious enough for big money i dont like the fake people coming along with it or using me for free things ideas i fell in love with an american guy a year older than me in my country he was there for a little with his mom i dropped the life i had in my country for him and moved with him to his moms house to america we didnt plan how i could live with him regarding visas etc later i got my ged got into a community college and then got my student visa denied because of my money and family situation ties i have only been here on travel visa and he wont move out of america again we have broken up times with me being gone for months in my country not having my appartement anymore just staying at my mom and working as like barista until he doesnt leave me alone and i come back again promising things that wont happen and it always works i spend everything i have emotionally and my money on him i pay for everything i never feel like i receive the same effort i have lost so much things in the process of trying to have this life with him he promises me but in the end after years with him i am left with nothing and there are never big changes for him hes still where he always is in a paid for apartment he comes from a very different upbringing than me no money worries and getting mostly anything he wants he is the weirdest guy i ever met and i guess i find comfort in that by feeling normal with him im never really the emotional person and i feel stable i dont want to speak bad of him and i do feel love which is very rare for me i hardly commit to someone and i think he is special i just feel like i come here just to beg for what he made me expect i traveled to asia where my dad is from for months in our breakup trying to see if i wanted to live there and if i could i loved it there but i missed him every day i always try getting back on track when we are broken up and to forget about him i try everything but nothing i feel feels as real as this so i spent euros on leaving asia asap when we were in contact to go back to him within days that was money i saved from the barista job i cant go to school here i cant have a job i cant make any money but what i do make with d i spend on groceries for us he doesnt want to marry me yet which is fine but i cant live here on a tourist visa and i cant keep living somewhere depending on someone i cant depend on he prioritizes himself when i am here and when i leave to focus on myself suddenly everything is about me and will change the next time this is the second time i am in love and both times i feel like i do everything for the other person not even dramatic but a reasonable amount of effort for truly loving someone i dont feel it back i dont feel like i am taking anything for granted im worried i am with a spoiled boy who just wants what he wants when he wants it until hes bored or has to put effort in and that keep going down this path will end up bad for me turning worries me i am following the school online but its too expensive for me to pay by myself so i might take a semester break i cant depend on anyone but myself going along in these plans have me so far off my original life plans sometimes he makes it seem like he is giving me opportunity by letting me stay with him in new york or that his mom has helped me out a couple times which i really am grateful for but it also feels like a trap i dont mean to portray anyone bad and i make bad decisions too but i really just want to give my life meaning and have true connection i try to be fair which is why i sacrifice so much of myself and what i did make for myself i dont get things handed but obviously i am grateful for growing up where i did and having enough to make a good life i feel guilty for not being happy and not creating a good life out of what i did have i feel very demotivated and on the edge emotionally i often want to end my life im not a victim in this story but i hope to get real advice sometimes i feel like we make progress and go towards something until i realize were not am i stuck in a loop,1,0

anyway too many times too much hurt too many times ive stabbed her mentally but shes such a huge part of my life its hard to let go i suppose well see what happens weve only seen each other a couple of times since the breakup this past month which is really upsetting for us both right but deep down i know its probably whats best for her and thats what i want she told me that my family and she just want me to get better i want that too but i feel like im getting nowhere i know the impact we have on our partners and families and i see how its destroying them so for their sake i get it what i struggle with is whether to keep engaging or just continue to fuck everything up because right now fucking everything up feels like a very sexy idea to me i mean whats the fucking point in building everything back up again in my life just for it to all go up in smoke againinevitably a couple of days ago during this current episode i tried to take my own life by drinking myself to death in january i left the country on my own without planning blacked out and then tried to drink myself to death ive done this before blacking out in another country and i still havent learned my lesson im such an idiot its so hard it really feels like someone else is taking control but i know i need to take accountability for my actions its as simple as that im really just writing this to get it off my chest ive been in this episode since a few weeks ago and thats when she finally called it quits shes told me it wasnt because of my mental health and i believe her but i also know it was a huge factor the truth is im just deeply unhappy even though im not my life was going well it still can go well but i always seem intent on destroying it my way of handling pressure is to burn it all down to smash it into a million pieces im struggling to control myself right now my brain is playing tricks on me im going through a lot and i get no support from medical professionals theres always a disconnect between me and them ive consulted with well over professionals in some way this year and ive gotten nowhere my mind is racing my thoughts are strange i have capacity to a degree but i dont know for how much longer that said writing this has made me feel a little bit lighter so thanks,2,0

specific event age makes likely cut ties walk away someone completely never looking back rather risking certain pain didnt used like mental health clearly impacted way relate others perceive risk hence question bpd could theoretically impact aunt case long version aunt past commented struggles number bpd traits im mired legal dispute aunt deceased uncles filed lawsuit actions following uncles death along comments others led believe might destroyed subsequent also maybe lawsuit way try recover exist two years later legal dispute cost us thousands dollars absolute mess attorney messed dragging process much longer needed ive subpoenaed uncles financial records im combing try find indication paid attorney draw subsequent obviously aunt furious would file lawsuit reason assuming dont find evidence subsequent would like approach aunt try theory heal relationship however think might hopeless try revive relationship two main reasons filing lawsuit implicit massive criticism would anyone irrespective mental health diagnosis actions following death embarrassing dont make sense especially given apparently left entire estate per purported recent filed lawsuit drew lot negative attention behavior actions would extremely shame inducing anyone know pwbpd guilt shame even difficult endure thank comments wishing good mental health,any hope for reconciliation after the public embarrassment of a lawsuit im not pwbpd this is a question about a family member mods please advise if i shouldnt post here tldr im considering approaching my aunt who has told me that she has bpd traits to try and explain my side and reconcile a massive messy legal dispute and to perhaps heal our relationship i dont know if its even worth trying because im wondering if she may have split me beyond redemption or she may feel guilty and wish to make up for some past actions or both id appreciate if pwbpd could weigh in on whether you personally might welcome the chance to reconcile with someone whereby youve wronged them but where you also feel they have subsequently wronged you and publically shamed you obviously this is a very individualized situation but im asking for thoughts on how bpd may or may not impact your handling of a highconflict situation with lots of family history behind it and where shame plays a very prominent role i also want to emphasize that its not my intent to vilify pwbpd or to suggest it makes someone incapable of navigating conflict my own ptsd from a specific event at age makes me more likely to cut ties and walk away from someone completely never looking back rather than risking certain pain again i didnt used to be like that my mental health has clearly impacted the way i relate to others and how i perceive risk hence the question about how bpd could theoretically impact my aunt in this case long version my aunt has in the past commented that she struggles with a number of bpd traits im now mired in a legal dispute with this aunt over a deceased uncles will i filed the lawsuit against her because her actions following this uncles death along with some comments from others led me to believe she might have destroyed a subsequent will but also maybe not a lawsuit was the only way to try and recover that will if it does exist two years later this legal dispute has now cost both of us thousands of dollars and is an absolute mess my own attorney messed up dragging out the process much longer than it needed to ive subpoenaed my uncles financial records and im combing through them to try and find any indication that he paid an attorney to draw up a subsequent will obviously my aunt is furious that i would file a lawsuit against her for any reason assuming i dont find evidence of a subsequent will i would like to approach my aunt and try to in theory heal the relationship however i think it might be hopeless to try and revive the relationship for two main reasons filing a lawsuit against her is an implicit massive criticism it would be for anyone irrespective of a mental health diagnosis her actions following his death were embarrassing and dont make sense especially given that he apparently left his entire estate to her per the purported most recent will my having filed a lawsuit against her drew a lot of negative attention to her behavior and actions the above would be extremely shame inducing to anyone and i know that for pwbpd guilt and shame can be even more difficult to endure thank you for any comments wishing good mental health to all,3,0

situation like im writers block something idk wellwritten post also little dating experience even seems obvious dont know go anyway guy f talking online month havent met irl live far message almost everyday video chat week know weve talking month havent met person know like think im attracted say think comes attraction toward others tend complicated feelings due complex mental health struggles past experiences specifically gut feels right never feel way anyone also intrusive thoughts imagine never anyone im emotionally numb dont emotional feelings im pretty sexually repressed put simply ill say unique way attracted addition hes also favorite person bpd complicates things fp cloud judgement feelings toward im also afraid since hes fp might lose interest one point fp like fp crush ive always felt way people way people moreso fp crushes shouldnt date never supposed romantically anyone life im sure feelings havent conversation yet past month weve four video calls recent one lasted hour calls hes attentive laughs things say smiles lot plus first days talking mightve hinting little bit attraction thought could friendly mean doesnt many friends maybe im one talk im sure feelings hasnt expressed maybe something holding back heres important thing mentioned title post im gon na going residential treatment mental health problems within next weeks obviously know im ready someone right tell feelings going away treatment wouldnt trying pursue something right id simply expressing feelings reason id get chest mind try heal treatment mean mind lot getting chest really think like despite confused feelings gut says genuinely want isnt interested know go away least process im gone also feel selfish im afraid im gone might find someone else meantime well hey mean maybe theres someone better doesnt many mental health problems tell feelings go maybe hed willing wait pursue something something makes apprehensive telling feelings hes going lot therapist said maybe best wait tell feel gets better itll adding onto already full plate may currently ready relationship something important note expressed desire someone right maybe something hed ready hear tell feelings treatment would known month half im sure thats enough time known someone tell youre especially case would never yet met person would done like video calls tldr tell feelings go get chest wont worry treatment tell feelings upfront feelings unique struggle romancerelationships say anything go early tell itd bad time hes going lot go residential figure tell feel bad tell someone feelings tell im also going mental retreat month,i want to tell this guy im into him but im also going away for residential mental health treatment soon and im not sure how to handle this before i begin i just wanted to say that my mind is fuzzy these days so i hope im writing this accurately my brain feels confused on this situation like im having writers block about it or something so idk how wellwritten this post is also i have very little dating experience so even if what i should do seems obvious i myself just dont know how to go about this anyway this guy m and i f have been talking online for a month now we havent met irl because we live far from each other we message each other almost everyday and video chat about once a week i know weve only been talking for a month and we havent met in person but what i do know about him i like i think im attracted to him i say i think because when it comes to attraction toward others i tend to have complicated feelings and this is due to my complex mental health struggles and past experiences specifically with him in my gut he feels right for me and i never feel that way about anyone i also have intrusive thoughts where i imagine myself with him which i never do with anyone but im emotionally numb so i dont have emotional feelings for him and im pretty sexually repressed to put it simply ill just say i have a unique way of being attracted to him in addition to this hes also my favorite person i have bpd which complicates things him being my fp does cloud my judgement of him and my feelings toward him im also afraid that since hes my fp i might lose interest in him at one point just as i have with all of my other fp like is he more of a fp or a crush ive always felt this way about people if this is the way i am where people are moreso fp than crushes and that i shouldnt date them because of this am i just never supposed to romantically be with anyone in my life im not sure if he has feelings for me we havent had a conversation about this yet but in the past month weve had four video calls and our most recent one lasted an hour during the calls hes attentive laughs at the things i say and smiles a lot plus during the first few days of talking he mightve been hinting a little bit at attraction thought it could just be him being friendly i mean he doesnt have many friends and maybe im just one of the few he has to talk to im just not sure if he has feelings but hasnt expressed them maybe something is holding him back heres an important thing which is mentioned in the title of this post im gon na be going to residential treatment for my mental health problems within the next few weeks obviously because of this i know im not ready to be with someone right now so if i were to tell him my feelings before going away for treatment i wouldnt be trying to pursue something with him right now id simply just be expressing my feelings the reason id do this is so i can get it off my chest and not have it be on my mind while i try to heal during treatment i mean its been on my mind a lot getting this off my chest i really do think i like him despite my confused feelings and my gut says i genuinely want him if he isnt interested and i know this before i go away at least i can process it while im gone i also feel selfish for this but im afraid that while im gone he might find someone else in the meantime well hey i mean maybe theres someone better out there for him who doesnt have as many mental health problems as i do if i tell him i have feelings for him before i go maybe hed be willing to wait to pursue something with me something that makes me apprehensive about telling him my feelings is that hes been going through a lot my therapist said maybe its best to wait to tell him how i feel until he gets better because itll be adding onto his already full plate that he may not currently be ready for a relationship but something important to note is that he has expressed desire to be with someone right now so maybe this is something hed be ready to hear if i were to tell him my feelings before treatment we would have known each other for about a month and a half or so which im not sure if thats enough time to have known someone to tell them youre into them especially in our case where we would have never yet met in person and would have only done like video calls by then tldr what do i do do i tell him my feelings before i go to get it off my chest so i wont have to worry about it during treatment if i do tell him my feelings should i be upfront about how they my feelings are unique and that i struggle with romancerelationships or should i not say anything before i go because its too early to tell him because itd be a bad time because hes going through a lot should i go to

unfortunately negotiating suddenly contracted covid needed rush brothers dogs emergency room combine heavy workload thenparalegal law graduate began unravel mentally ended hospitalised entered

though worry might coping mechanism avoidance issues confided shes trying think ongoing mental health issues around time exploring new guy option shes course free explore whatever new avenues love wishes ive voiced enormous amount support decision via text message worry things might adding part larger mental health crisis bubbling surface though ill save another time point post id gone believing stigmatizing narratives surrounding bpd seeing really ex deeply traumatized woman monster succubus demon shes woman human dominated deeply held fears control life point distorting view reality brain might feel supported one moment unworthy next struggling human longing connection friendship versus fears come fear losing people fear losing something big fast fear unworthy love support freely given someone wonderful see turmoil inner conflict struggle identity need push people away dont abandon first finally understand manifested contradictory often hurtful behaviour saw wont defend behaviour see root pain fear see truly see shes less beautiful day met bpd doesnt make someone less deserving loved love think always kind feelings sort never truly go away even ride along greener pastures decide ultimate destiny hope wherever ends surrounded people see understand lower moments arent carefully crafted hurt people instead deeply rooted automated defence mechanisms deepest fears matter always support friendship always stand wants eventually give go option im saying happen door always open status single lines theres still much left learn might ask questions future posts regarding really feel like ive made breakthrough way simply hadnt worthy love everyone reading,after three years i think i finally understand my ex w bpd and ive come full circle in a good way my ex and i broke up nearly three years ago and the journey after the fact has been complicated i didnt know she had bpd being shes in the quietdiscouraged subtype and because how much emotional damage the final couple of weeks did to me i was bitter and angry for a long time i never sent anything abusive her way nor was i cruel to her when i found out but i was in a deeply raw place i gave into a lot of stigmatizing rhetoric and closed my heart to empathy this didnt line up with my values but my entire world had been turned upside down by this break up and my value system went with it last year however when my cat got sick a cat that she had been quite close with we reconnected and when we met up for the first time in literally years it was like nothing ever happened that same electricity that same spark and it didnt take long for me to remember exactly why i fell in love with her to begin with she was kind intelligent curious and she had this childlike sense of wonder that i found utterly compelling id been severely depressed for weeks but all of a sudden it was like my brain came back to life we were sensible in our conversations following she told me that seeing me had made her feel whole in a way she hadnt in a long time and suddenly we were texting away again it didnt take long for us to talk about getting back together but we also both knew that the relationship ended for a reason and we needed to discuss those reasons if we were going to commit once more and once again she really impressed me she took accountability and responsibility for her side of the break up in a way i didnt think was even possible for someone with bpd and it began fundamentally shift my view my stigmas were melting away in the face of direct evidence that bpders are capable of growth it might not be as easy but the proof was in the pudding she didnt just give me some platitude she broke down exactly what went wrong without me giving her any clues or prompts she demonstrated a true understanding and made me feel safe to take responsibility for my own side as well we didnt get back together unfortunately as we were negotiating she suddenly contracted covid and needed to rush her brothers dogs to the emergency room and when you combine that with her heavy workload as a thenparalegal now law graduate she began to unravel mentally and ended up being hospitalised again we entered a willthey wontthey phase where there was still romantic language being used but her mental health struggles were creating a block from moving forward and other things have happened since very positive healing things but events best left for another post shes now with someone else though i worry it might be a coping mechanism or avoidance of her issues as she confided in me that shes trying not to think about her ongoing mental health issues and this was around about the time she was exploring this new guy as an option shes of course free to explore whatever new avenues of love she wishes and ive voiced an enormous amount of support for her decision via text message i just worry that things might be adding up to this being part of a larger mental health crisis bubbling under the surface again though ill save that for another time my point for this post is that id gone from believing the stigmatizing narratives surrounding bpd to seeing what it really was my ex is a deeply traumatized woman not a monster not a succubus nor a demon shes a woman a human being dominated by deeply held fears that control her life to the point of distorting her very view of reality her brain might feel supported one moment and unworthy the next struggling with that all too human longing for connection and friendship versus the fears that come with it the fear of losing people the fear of losing herself to something too big too fast the fear of being unworthy of the love support that is so freely given to someone as wonderful as her i see the turmoil the inner conflict the struggle with identity itself the need to push people away so they dont abandon her first and i finally understand how it manifested in the contradictory often hurtful behaviour that i saw i wont defend the behaviour but i now see what it was at its root pain fear i see her now truly see her and shes no less beautiful to me now than she was the day i met her having bpd doesnt make someone any less deserving of being loved and i do love her and i think i always will the kind of feelings i have for her are the sort that never truly go away even as you ride along to greener pastures its not up for me to decide her ultimate destiny but i hope that wherever she ends up she is surrounded by people who see her and understand that her lower moments arent carefully crafted to hurt people but are instead deeply rooted automated defence mechanisms by her deepest fears and no matter what she will always have my support my friendship and i will always stand up for her and if she wants to eventually give it a go again she has that option too im not saying this will happen only that the door will always be open to her if our status as single lines up once more theres still so much left to learn and i might ask some questions in future posts regarding that but i really feel like ive made a breakthrough in a way that i simply hadnt before she is worthy of love and everyone reading this is too,94,18

was stuck with my abusive father no money and no idea what to do i was on medication and preparing to go to therapy alcohol and weed were my only comfort together wirh sleeping endlessly all my friends were in the uk so i was isolated but had no money to move back to cut it short i moved to another city to take dbt and ended up staying there i started a business for translation but then my mental health spiraled again and i got fired by my major client and then had a breakdown i had to go to a hospital for months and after i returned i just couldnt imagine working a high stress job again i took a part time job as a housekeeper its been almost years and i am still doing this job i enjoy it but the poverty it keeps me in is unbearable i feel like i failed and i cant get back up my best friend often hints that i am not doing enough to turn my life around but i feel like this is the time my mental illness really started to cripple me and i feel stuck no money for more therapy i recently lost my first independent flat and if it wasnt for a guy i started dating month prior i would end up in a sharehouse again i am i am now living with him as something as a house girlfriend still working parttime i feel so guilty about myself being like this i keep telling myself i will look for a new job i will do x and y but i never do i am stuck and i feel hopeless i am ashamed to even mention my career when someone asks and i hate myself for being like this i cant relate to other people most of the time and i cant explain why my boyfriend is a great guy and he is the only person that is supporting me right now but the process is so slow i feel like once he removed the financial burden of my back i just crashed and started sleeping and doing nothing but of course the chores are taken care of weve been living together for months and things are good but i feel like i really need to get a job that earns more because i feel like a burden i earn way below average wage in my country i dont want to be like this but i am just stuck i wonder if anyone else deals with similar emotions thanks for reading this long post i appreciate it,2,0

always eavesdrop time get update life never asked day boyfriend see less makes sad think become attached least times month mourn end relationship got scared alone know graduates forget truly scared alone future feel like one closest friends since known longer current friends never happen also feel like time make friend always start making new friends similar tastes become closer one another make

kids however tend try see things pessimistic try think current friendships end one day kelly arent meant friends love wasnt really meant alone alright love alone know lie keep thinking dying one day one coming funeral im important anyone one day everything alright guess,just vending sorry for the long post and the poor grammar i hate my life a lot i have a lot of depressing thoughts a lot now which i hate im from a different country and ever since i moved to the us i feel like i have never really had any close relationship with anyone ever since i was a kid i have always been a people pleaser i will try to do what my friends want so they can stay friends with me during my last academic year in my country i was bullied eventually i moved to the us and i had a hard making friends in middle school i always ate by myself if it was possible for me to skip lunch break i would skip when i thought i was making a friend in th grade the girl told me i didnt need to sit with her all the time during lunch after that i stop talking to her because i felt unwanted by her during that time also my distant cousins will bullied me making fun of me for not having friends or having sleepovers with friends around that time i became really shy and got addicted to watching anime because that was the only thing that brought me happiness i then go to high school i still dont really make friends there either around the nd semester of th grade i befriended this girl who would sit by herself during lunch but then she became really close with this other girl and they had more things in common and her new friend seemed to not like me eventually our friendship ended and covid happened when we returned to high school my senior year i befriended another girl and it was great until this other girl joined our group and it became more of a duo between them than a trio i did make one really good friend though but she has now got to a university out of state so we hardly talk when i went to college i was excited in the beginning i had a few people i was sort of talking to during the first semester but we stopped talking the nd semester i started feeling really lonely around that time i really wanted a boyfriend since i had never dated before but it never worked out i had roommates but i soothed or became friends kelly with one kelly and i have been roommates for almost years now my sophomore year was the worst i cried a lot and didnt have any friends so right after class i went to my dorm kelly and i got a little closer around that time but i was also depressed there were a few times she would invite me to hang out with her friends but i would say no because i was scared of socializing with others im bad at socializing in a group setting i was also sometimes very quiet around the time now it is my third year and i feel like our friendship is falling apart and it worries me a lot we dont speak as much as we used to i feel like she hates my presence a lot of the time sometimes when im around her im scared of what to say because i dont want her to hate me for example when we live in the dorm we usually say goodbye to one another but there will be times she doesnt say it and i think she hates me when i asked her how was her day she responded that it was good sometimes with a very annoying tone towards me i usually ask her that because i want us to talk about our day because when she comes to the dorm at the end of the day thats the only time i truly get to talk to her i will ask a question and she will seem very annoyed by my question i am sometimes scared of talking to her about certain things in my life because i dont want to be judged by her i am jealous of her she has an easier time socializing with people and talking with guys she will tell me she is story we dont get to talk much because she has been talking all day with her other friends which i understand but then on days i ask about her day and she gives a basic answer she will always call a friend to chat about her day with them and i always eavesdrop because that is the only time i get any update on her life she never asked me about how my day was when she has a boyfriend i see her less which makes me sad i think i have become too attached to her at least a few times a month i mourn the end of our relationship because to me she is all i got and i am scared to be alone i know once she graduates she will forget me i am truly scared of being alone in the future i feel like i should be one of her closest friends since i have known her longer than some of her current friends but that will never happen i also feel like each time i make a friend they always start making new friends who have more similar tastes to them and they become more closer to one another i did make a new friend last semester and it is great but i dont feel close to them when im with them i dont feel lonely once they are gone i feel lonely again i think a lot of people think im happy because i make myself seem that way but i am sad i keep telling myself one day i wont be sad i will have friends and wont feel lonely and i will have a husband and kids however i tend to try to see things more pessimistic i try to think all the current friendships i have will end one day that kelly and i arent just meant to be friends love wasnt really meant for me and being alone is alright i can love

groups based around duh thats ive reach people dont respond chat things go nowhere doesnt work nice people meet people interest like sometimes even disliking things im autistic hyperfixations important im able pretend care shit honestly im readable person want bond shared interests experiences ill get random messages people saying hi one word responses worst nightmare point theyll end nothing common wonder reached im talkative expressive downright annoying need something like friend someone isnt obsessed someone ramble nothing everything upon time best friend moreso twin even briefly married toxic make work remained abusive going nocontact sometimes wan na run back beg take back least know theyre good friend know ill always feel home understood every interest common basically twins nobody else feels know wont find experience need something like im tired shallow surface level stuff people cant relate cant related feel like goldfish bowl bird whos stuck cage longs fly friends miss someone talk anything text brother cant really much besides try support man miss rambling shit people lot pent emotion want listened tolerated want someone least try understand im talking option making friends outside house im college yet even visiting campus scares people even ive taken edible usually takes edge im reading lot posts people cant make friends college im afraid wont able either theres clubs theyre super lame one even remotely relatable anime club dont even like anime besides jojos know ill find neurodivergents thatll make anxious since amygdala cant tell friend foe right cant even go building without beginning panic meds dont help either reason cant go conventions meet ups social anxiety even im blacked practically seizing im still afraid nervous logically know nothing worry insecurity goes deep see people well established social hierarchies special places cliques found families im never part even try im friendly im approachable make active effort interact others online irl nobody wants even try hide lonelydepressed dont scare anyone away sometimes im bit awkward uh blatantly autistic time want make people laugh random shit people want one friendships like movies want squad like social media hasnt helped become social either met ex instagram chance ive trying recreate circumstances far nothing bothering years cry keep going life dead inside,i have nobody and its so painful im not sure how to socialize and its eating away at me ive always been a loner not by choice i cant even make online friends everyone i meet ghosts me or is a brick wall to talk to even people with the same interests never end up clicking with me i give people a lot of time to see if we gel together but so far nothing i like people who spam text and will bother me just like how i like to text my every thought lol otherwise it feels so bland it doesnt help that i have very limited interests and strange ones at that the answer i get is ok so look for groups based around that no duh thats what ive been doing i reach out to people who dont respond i have a chat and things go nowhere it just doesnt work the few nice people i meet are people who have no interest in what i like sometimes even disliking those things im autistic and my hyperfixations are very important im not able to pretend to care about other shit honestly im a very readable person i want to bond over shared interests and experiences ill get random messages from people saying hi but one word responses are my worst nightmare at this point then theyll end up having nothing in common and i wonder why they reached out at all im very talkative expressive downright annoying and i need something like that in a friend someone who isnt obsessed with me but someone who can ramble with me about nothing and everything at all once upon a time i had a best friend moreso a twin we were even briefly married for a while but we were both too toxic to make it work and they remained abusive were both going nocontact sometimes i just wan na run back and beg them to take me back because at least i know theyre a good friend i know that ill always feel at home and understood by them we have every interest in common were basically twins and nobody else feels the same i know i wont find that same experience again but i need something like that im tired of shallow surface level stuff with people who cant relate and cant be related to i feel like a goldfish in a bowl a bird whos stuck in a cage and longs to fly with its friends i just miss having someone to talk to about anything i only text my brother and he cant really do much besides try to support me but man i miss rambling about shit to people i have a lot of pent up emotion and i want to be listened to and not just tolerated i want someone who can at least try to understand what im talking about the only other option is making friends outside of the house im not in college yet but even visiting campus scares me with all the people even when ive taken an edible which usually takes all the edge off im reading a lot of posts about how people cant make friends in college and im so afraid i wont be able to either theres clubs but theyre super lame the only one even remotely relatable is the anime club but i dont even like anime besides jojos i just know ill find other neurodivergents there but thatll make me anxious too since my amygdala cant tell friend from foe right now i cant even go into the building without beginning to panic meds dont help either for the same reason i cant go to conventions or meet ups because of the social anxiety even when im not blacked out or practically seizing im still afraid and nervous logically i know i have nothing to worry about but the insecurity goes so deep all i see are people who have well established social hierarchies and have their own special places in their cliques their found families and im never part of that even when i try to be im friendly im approachable i make an active effort to interact with others online and irl but nobody wants me i even try to hide how lonelydepressed i am so i dont scare anyone away sometimes im a bit awkward or uh blatantly autistic but most of the time i just want to make people laugh and do random shit with people i want to have one of those friendships like in s movies i want a squad like that social media hasnt helped me become social either i met my ex on instagram by chance so ive been trying to recreate those circumstances but so far nothing this has been bothering me for years and all i can do about it is cry and keep going through life dead inside,3,2

look like im coping pretty well but internally im screaming i know they say it gets worse before it gets better but i feel like everything is falling apart im years old and i feel like ive got nothing left to live for i have no job no friends no relationship nobody in my life who has a positive impact upon it everything is such a mess and i dont know how im supposed to get myself out of this or if i even want to my auntie was the only person in my life who cared about me she was my one source of support and stability in the world i miss having someone to talk to someone to have a laugh with someone who was always there if i needed a hug it felt like we were a team as wed always help each other in any way we could now i feel all alone in the world and ive never felt so isolated i dont know if i can keep going without her everything seems like a chore and i dont find joy in anything when im in a more rational state of mind i know what im about to say is stupid but its definitely a recurring thought i honestly wish i wouldve gone when she did i know im young and have my life ahead of me but ive got nothing and no one left theres not been one day since she died that ive actually been glad i woke up im currently sat at the beach on a really nice sunny afternoon everyone around me is enjoying their time outside with someone else im sat alone on a bench looking on from the sidelines i dont have anyone in my life anymore and its so lonely ive always felt alone to a degree but never on this scale now with grief added on top i feel like im not really a part of society anymore im existing not living ive tried to find people who could maybe relate to me but its come to nothing i dont get my hopes up anymore when i see someone that seems to be in a similar situation to me everyone either ignores me or just says im sorry or good luck and moves on i can appreciate from my post that i dont sound like a very fun person to be around but i am much more cheerful when im talking to people i just feel like i have to make posts like this to find people who might feel the same and understand i have no patience anymore for surface level interactions but talking about deep things freaks a lot of people out i know you have to build up a level of trust to have those conversations and id happily take the time and effort to get to know someone its just finding someone that i connect with in the first place i have so much love and kindness to give but ive never had anyone even give me a chance i just want to matter to someone that hope of eventually finding someone is the only thing keeping me alive right now i dont really have anything to talk about with people im surrounded by irl nobody wants to talk about heavier topics like grief which i can understand but its hard when you feel you have no one to turn to its pretty much consuming my life at the moment so it would be nice to have somebody if i needed them apart from the grief i have nothing going on in my life right now except for feeling miserable that means im either forgotten in a group conversation or i have people projecting all their personal life on me i find that when people are telling me about their lives im just nodding and not taking in anything theyre saying i never wouldve been like that before and i never used to zone out of conversations completely ive not genuinely laughed or smiled since my auntie died its all fake smiles and pleasantries from me im glad other people are happy and have things going on in their lives but everything seems so superficial and pointless to me im my own worst enemy because im so lonely yet when im in other peoples company im just waiting until i can leave no one who i converse with is anything like me its the classic lonely in a room full of people feeling the thing that scares me is that i dont seem to care anymore sure ive had days in the past where ive been in a bad mood and not wanted to do anything but this is another level for example in the past i wouldve been really stressed about having no job and therefore no income but now even though i know my savings will run out eventually im not making an effort to do anything about it i know how i can solve some issues in my life and im not proud of my attitude towards certain things but i cant push myself to do anything im the most depressed ive ever been deep down i know i want to get better but i dont see the point in trying to make a life for myself if im always going to feel so out of place and isolated nothing i seem to do makes me feel any better and if it does its a temporary fix i can be having a half decent day but the minute im left alone with my thoughts i feel awful and often break down crying this might sound strange but one of the things that made me realise how bad things have got is me losing my love for music ive loved music for as long as i can remember and it was what i always gravitated towards if i was struggling ive gone from listening to songs everyday for hours to having several days where i dont listen to a thing it also used to be a great distraction but anytime i listen music now my thoughts overpower it and i cant focus on any part of the song i was on the train a few days ago and i used to love listening to music whilst watching the world go by but i cant even enjoy that anymore i nearly ended up crying on the train and its not the first time thats happened i think because i know it isnt going to solve anything in the long run i cant seem to justify spending time listening to it my thought processes have really been messed up im trying my best to look after myself and push forward because i know that whats my auntie wouldve wanted i know eventually ill be grateful to my past self for pushing through this i try my best to go out and have some new experiences but most of the time i dont end up feeling any better i find myself getting stressed out by other peoples actions and if anywhere is crowded i just want to run away im happy doing some things alone but when its all the time nothing seems fun i just find it hard when there seems to be no purpose for anything anymore every night i lie in bed and question whether this is all that life has to offer me if so id quite happily fall asleep and never wake back up i needed to get all this misery out somewhere as i have no one to discuss it with i do usually feel better for a while when i post something like this but all the heaviness will come back eventually i feel like its never going to leave me and ill always have this dull ache in my chest im honestly scared where this is all going to end im fighting the urge to hide away and shut myself in completely i know im probably not the best person to be around at the moment but i need someone im not saying this to big myself up but ive always been the one to help others put their feelings and needs before mine im sick of hearing so many people online saying you need to work on yourself before getting involved with others romantically or platonically theres times in life when were all at our worst and need a bit of help and support from somebody im not greedy i just need one person who i click with who gets me i just wish someone would come and save me for once,2,0

stories relevant link part one story dont know talk wanted vent reddit void tldr theres lot bad people places shouldnt places like military found found anywhere im venting fears,killers in the military i dont know who to talk to about this because ive pretty much separated myself from any social associations i had in the military i dont really know what to say about to any of my family members about this and i dont want to because its a pretty distressing thing to come to realize the title is a little odd but that is because i do not believe that everyone who joins the military is a killer or even capable of killing someone most people in the military do not end up hurting anybody whether on accident on or on purpose im one of those people who never wish to hurt anybody thankfully i was never given orders to do anything like that my service was during the covid pandemic and my specific mos was based around support and infrastructure i always figured the majority of people would struggle with that kind of decision i even tried to bolster myself as up as much as i could being tougher than i normally am and doing things a little bit more intimidatingly whether or not this worked on others it certainly worked for me as a sort of shield during my first night of what i considered service was the hotel stay on the way to boot camp there i was placed in a room with another prospective service member i dont think this young man s experience is typical but he had already passed the checks already went through the psychological evaluation talk to all the same people that i did he was supposed to be good to go as far as i know he is still serving to this day that night that i stayed with him in the hotel he told me that he wants to kill somebody he believes that he has a level of testosterone that could only be managed by the military and through the acts of violence he signed up for bravo in the army while i dont think there was any experience that i was able to notice in my boot camp there was one thing that happened one of my higherups that was in command of a separate division had come in late one night he went to his allfemale portion of the dorms he was very drunk i dont know what happened after that details are foggy and a lot of different things say a lot of things happened the higher up was no longer in charge of that division the next day the one thing that the females from that division had told me was he was super nice up until that point my next experience was in our advanced schooling system this was what we were supposed to attend to after boot camp in order to train for the actual mos that we do there was no shortage of shenanigans that came with a newfound freedom of the people who had just been released from boot camp there where sometimes where it would go beyond that sometimes there would be fights sometimes people would let loose their true natures one in person in particular threw up gang signs from his hometown this person lived with us knew who we all were and where we all sleeped i had heard about people like him before joining gang members in the military getting free training after that i was placed in my unit i was really eager to try and fix things i unfortunately had a couple of problems myself that had developed over the course of my advanced schooling program however i still got to see people train i still got to be a part of it i still got to see what they thought how they moved and what they did when the pressure was on this was a bizarrely effective smoke screen when everyone is desperate no one is people would say and do things that would be seen as worrisome on the outside say things like im going to kill you im going to hurt you i watched words like these passed back and forth between fellow service members nearly daily and it was very hard to to distinguish which ones were real on my first tour we were replacing a different unit everybody was drinking i wasnt there but everyone heard about the service member who was sent back home with missing teeth and a shattered jawline because of those problems i had developed during my a school and eventually had tempered through my tours of duty i was sent to a special place in order to recover these places were meant for mental health recovery some people there were veterans brought back in order to have this treatment done somewhere just about to leave and others like myself were going to treatment in order to go back to service this place was not much short of a paradise besides the restrictive movement we were allowed to make our own meals and basically ran around schedules it was here that a veteran who had returned to civilian life was giving me an anecdote to try and make a point he told me that he ran somebody off the road and violently attacked that person the reason why he was here in this facility now was because it was either go to this facility or go to jail he said this to me to get me to do something he wanted i dont remember what i think it had something to do with cleaning though i didnt do it because fuck him i have a few more but it was at this point that i realized that there was something going on im not really a stranger to violence i prefer peace and i pick peaceful situations whenever possible normally if somebody threatens me the system is that i try to walk away and if that doesnt work i ask for help and if that doesnt work i retaliate physically its something entirely different when you can do none of these things during my second tour of duty i had broken some bones my plan was to do a lot of exploring that tour but with my incapacitated state the most i could get out of it was drinking and bar visits i did try to make the most of it but mostly because i didnt want to be in my dorm you see my roommate had some sort of issue with me i dont know what it was but he would always call me a bitch casually so i would ignore him sometimes he wouldnt allow that he got right up in my ear sometimes one day he threatened me the same day i got a couple of tools from my station and hid them around just in case i think he knew something was up because he wouldnt talk to me for the rest of the tour that and i also started playing with knives a lot more whenever he was near me the doubleedged sword was that now everybody was on edge and now i was starting to look like the crazy person it didnt let up at all it just got worse constantly eventually i started getting into fights i couldnt tell anymore who was somebody who was going to try and hurt me i mean they put me in the same room with someone who said he was going to rape me they didnt want to listen whenever i told them they sent me away to another facility calling me crazy i will be transparent because of my actions i had broken a contract that i had signed on repeat behaviors those repeat behaviors were drinking that is why i was sent to a mental health facility on more than one occasion i would like to also clarify that this was not because a violent drinking this was not because of dereliction of duty this is not because of legal or financial issues associated with drinking i asked for help i knew i had a problem and i wanted help they sent me to places to recover where i was threatened at least once every time by my own people other service members went when they werent doing that they were bunking me with those people i think im going to make this next story the last one i was never ordered to commit violence against other people but i was ordered to stop my own people underwatch if they decided to commit violence against other people this was a pretty mundane duty if i had to guess it was meant for a person who is a higher rank than me so i took it to heart was proud of the duty but was also fair and lenient i wanted the people who were under my watch to believe that i was trustworthly in case they said something or did something that would have put the lives of others at risk i wanted to know i knew this course of action may be the best take because the rumors that for the people who were under watch were that they were going to hurt people within the unit some of them had begun stockpiling weapons ammunition explosives all of these things were confiscated long before i got to my station and i knew the guy he was always friendly towards me what i didnt know about was his list of names not until he told me sometimes i wish i had just been a hard ass kept my mouth shut and did my duty as it was written he never got the chance to hurt anybody he was on his way out the door by the time i adopted the station it feels like these people are everywhere i thought i could go someplace and find camaraderie but im not a killer no one in my family is a killer and no one who i talk to is a killer if its my choice and within my knowledge i do not associate with murderers i know the difference ive seen defence and assault i thought most of these people were okay stable balanced likeminded i thought these people wanted to help to make the world a better place to serve their duty and protect their people but some people just want to hurt others ive been struggling with this thought for a long time with the way that my country is starting to show its colors with the way that i look back and wonder how much ive gotten away with because people might think im a specific race people are always surprised whenever i tell them what my roots actually are and with this cognito hazard level knowledge of sometimes theres just fucking killers in positions of authority i dont know what to fear and i dont know what to trust ive been struggling for what feels like years now but its been a little over a year trying to tell my therapist this experience i have not been able to portray in words to her the feelings that i have written down today i am scared of the world and the world seems to care only in a way where it is antagonistic i do look for hope i make an exercise of it every single day sometimes are harder than others but it is always hard and it is getting harder i have more stories of violence threats and acts against my life both before and after my military service i wouldnt consider those stories as relevant but they do link up its all part of one story after all i just dont know who to talk to about this so i wanted to vent to the reddit void tldr theres a lot of bad people in places they shouldnt be places like the military if they can be found there they can be found anywhere im venting

feel beyond fucked please anyone give hope anyone experienced something similar found way suggestions im desperate please leave comment gentle tender please im fragile point thank,please help how do i get out of this i really need advice support things are bleak five years ago a repressed memory of abuse came up while i was reading an article it shook me so much that i went into a constant state of severe depersonalisation with no internal dialogue or images in my mind and a feeling of being completely cut off from the rest of the world it was horrible it was like i had deid i tried many different techniques tools but nothing got through not even a little bit last year i reached my limit and decided i couldnt take it anymore i knew i needed the dissociation to go or i would end things as my life had become so empty and dark i did more research and started internal family systems therapy as i stumbled across many success stories on reddit the therapy went well too well after a few months the dissociation lowered quite suddenly and strongly and to my shock extreme repressed trauma came up and i realised both of my parents had subjected me to truly evil things between years old suddenly my whole life was turned upside down i was facing hours upon hours of painful body flashbacks every single day reliving their abuse from beginning to end in full detail this went on for months leaving me constantly exhausted and on edge terrified of when the next flashback would hit me i also started having symptoms of a spiritual awakening energy moving up my spine heightened intuition noticing synchronicities and messages from higher realms although i wonder now if this is psychosis in january things got worse the dissociation lowered further despite me desperately wanting it to stay strong i had a panic attack while outside at night the sky suddenly looked massive and terrifying and have been completely agoraphobic since unable to leave my flat or even look out the window for longer than a few minutes shortly after this i had a flashback to extreme hunger i was starved often as a child and no matter how much i ate the feeling would not leave me it was truly horrible and i was close to ending it just to escape from the horrible seeminglyendless pain once it finally passed i was left traumatised and found myself too scared to eat for two whole weeks i was desperately hungry losing weight watching myself get weaker and weaker before finally i was able to push through the intense inner resistance and start drinking nutritional drinks from my doctor which im still on now a month later during these two weeks of hell a friend came to stay with me and care for me she was by my side when she left to go back to work i found i was now terrified of being by myself it felt completely impossible for me like i would die if i let that happen so since then i have had to ask other friends to stay with me and constantly swap between eachother so that i always have a person in my living room with me im so thankful for their help but i know its not a permanent solution im still dissociated but not as much as i need to be im in this horrible halfstate where i can remember painful things and feel painful things but still fully feeling stuck in the present moment feeling so separate from the world and other people with no access to self energy so i cant do parts work or the knowledge of techniques that could help me the only thing that fills my mind is constant intrusive thoughts and images thoughts of how im going to hell how im crazy and broken how everything is over for me at this point my parts are all extreme and directly opposed to each other one part desperately wants me to work with a therapist again but another one is completely against the idea as therapy led to me being in my current crisis there is so much pressure inside my chest as i can feel both parts pulling and pushing against eachother constantly and then multiply that pressure by as theres all these other parts warring against eachother over different things i feel utterly paralysed and unable to make any decisions because of the fear of the inevitable backlash i cant allow myself to go to a psych ward done it once years ago never again my issues are too complex and i truly feel like i would end up in there for the rest of my life with how traumatised i am to me that is a fate worse than anything i was trapped all throughout childhood i cant endure being trapped again at the moment i have started on mg of sertraline although i am not noticing any big changes yet i keep hoping it will numb me or reduce the overwhelm i also have access to benzos but i hold off on using them due to the potential for addiction i am waiting to speak to my doctor where i will be asking for antipsychotics as i need the noise in my head to stop outside of this i sit in my living room all day and try to distract myself with conversations with my friends video games feeling every minute slowly drag by until i go to bed and get a brief reprieve from the mental torture before waking up in an emotional flashback the other day i woke up in such a bad anxiety attack that it felt like my chest was vibrating and my whole body shook so much it was as though i was possessed sometimes a suicidal part of me takes over and its desperation and power is so scary all it wants is for me to end things right in that moment i somehow find the strength to hold myself against it and sit for hours until it passes but its the hardest thing in the world the muscles in my back get so painful from tensing against this force inside me and im scared that one day this part of me will win i dont want to die guys i truly dont ive worked so hard and survived so much i have friends i love and i know i have so much to live for but i feel like ive fallen into something impossible here it breaks my heart as all i was trying to do was heal i did what i thought was the right thing by going to therapy but it has led to this its been almost months straight of the worst kind of torture and i feel beyond fucked please can anyone give me hope has anyone experienced something similar and found a way out any suggestions for what i should do im desperate please if you leave a comment be so gentle and tender please im so fragile at this point thank you,1,4

should i seek professional help im a years old guy soon thats recently been made aware that i might have some mild symptoms of ptsd trigger warning abuse physical violence and psychological abuse ill start out by saying that im sorry if this doesnt belong here but im really looking for advice ill share my story and you can read it if you want to get more context the most important parts though are the symptoms i think im experiencing which are at the end of the post the symptoms started appearing for me very recently after i ended all contact with my abusive ex and im afraid they might affect the relationship im in now it all began in april when i started talking to a guy whom i thought was really nice at the time my last grandparent had passed away only months after my other grandparent at the time i hadnt come out yet but i saw an opportunity with the upcoming pride event in my city i came out because of himhe showed genuine interest in me and told me he saw a future with me my coming out was full of support from friends and family and i didnt receive any negative feedback however after i came out everything changed he wanted just a friends with benefits situation he became distant and when i asked to hang out he would cancel or outright refuse most times calling me clingy eventually after a while he would come back to me telling me he missed me and we would hang out again this cycle repeated for a long time and even though he was the one who wanted a friendswithbenefits arrangement he mostly treated it like a relationship which messed with my head at that time i was larger and had very low selfesteem which made it even harder to leave when he came back he made me feel loved again and those were the only times i felt loved but sometimes he would tear me down he once told me i had a spine like a worm and he made cruel comparisons about people like service workers saying things like hes really hot and i bet hes so much smarter than you he made other hurtful jokes about my intelligence and appearance which made me feel awful every time i confronted him about ittelling him that even if it was a joke it wasnt funny and it hurthis response was always im sorry you feel that way but youre overreacting because of his terrible behavior and my low selfesteem i didnt have the strength to leave him i felt like i wasnt worth more than that as a result i developed a mild eating disorder and almost stopped eating while simultaneously walking km miles every day from june to august i went from kg lbs to kg lbs and it took a huge toll on my body i was losing my mind i was depressed and convinced i was the problem all he could say was youre being dramatic or youre too clingy and hed threaten to end things but he always kept me around breadcrumbing me just in case he wantedneeded my love and affection one time i spilled a glass of water on his coffee table when i got up to get a paper towel he immediately reacted in anger yelling and grunting as i reached for the paper towel he pushed me aside and hit me with all of his strength in the chest i lost my breath for a few seconds and kinda blacked out in disbelief i stood there silent watching in terror as he wipe away the water when i told him it wasnt okay he said i know im sorry but i did it because you didnt apologize immediately our relationship eventually shifted to just friends per his request and i started seeing other people but as soon as i did hed show interest again hed touch me weirdly caress me and send suggestive photos which made me even more confused i was blinded by my love for him so i excused his behavior at one point during oktober we had a deeper conversation where he apologized for everything hed done to me blaming it on his childhood trauma and past relationships fast forward to december he started becoming more affectionate complimenting me caressing me and holding meeverything id wanted from the beginning then in midjanuary he asked me to be his partner and i said yes as it was everything i had dreamed of after that that he went to china for the whole month of february where i discovered he had made a new snapchat account to talk at other people and get nudes i discovered it and my heart dropped when i called him out on it he said im so sorry i dont know why i do these things and me being naive forgave him but when he came home he became distant again the relationship came to an abrupt end in early april just a week after my birthday when i asked him what was wrong and he said he didnt love me anymore he claimed it wasnt a breakup so i went along with it he never officially broke up with me but slowly returned to using dating apps and reverted to his old ways from april to july our relationship was on and off one time i got so fed up with his treatment that we had a long conversation and he said i can see myself in you and you remind me of me back then and i know exactly how you feel i was in the same situation i responded so why would you put me in this situation cant you see why im scared of ending up like you this continued until august when i finally moved on from our romantic relationship and focused purely on the friendship aspect at this point at had done a lot of rediscovering of myself in late august i matched with a sweet guy on tinder who treats me right weve been going strong ever since i kept my friendship with my ex during this time and told my current partner that we were just friends and there was no need to worryit would never be anything more fast forward to november my ex texted me a very explicit photo drunk with the message sorry just a little horny right now my heart sank i told him it was the most disgusting thing he could do to me after everything id been through and i cut him off i immediately told my partner what happened and that i had cut my ex out of my life my ex then sent me multiple apologetic messages trying to make it up to me he played the everyone leaves me card in his messages one day i texted him and told him he had to stop contacting me because every time i saw his name on my screen or saw him in public i wished the worst for him the last message he sent was a long apology where he essentially said im sorry my childhood trauma showed in my behavior towards you in other words apologizing to me for having a bad childhood thats the story and of course there is more to it he did a lot of awful things but this sums it up just a bit but heres how it affects my everyday life now im scared of intimacy now because back then it was a means of survival to keep him close sexualizing myself though i didnt want to because other wise he wouldnt need me i think about how he treated me almost every day because it was so damaging sometimes if i go to places we went to im taken back to that time if i play a game it triggers memories of him when i look in the mirror im reminded of it sometimes im reminded of the time he hit me im always afraid of speaking up because im scared of being told im overreacting i have terrible dreams about him where im constantly running away from him im always wary of my surroundings afraid of running into him it happened once in public transport and i had what felt like a panic attack my mind is often preoccupied thinking about all the things he did wanting him to suffer the way i did its happening more and more and i hate it even when i just go to lie down for a quick nap i sometimes relive these moments and its mentally draining to have to see his face every time i close my eyes im genuinely scared that these things will ruin my current relationship because i dont want him to have this effect on me and i refuse to be like him i dont want to claim that i have ptsd since it might just be a response from my nervous system after living on high alert for almost a but im looking for advice from others who may have been in a similar situation in the past i went to my doctor because i didnt want to live anymore but at the time he dismissed me because i didnt meet the requirements to get a psychologist so before i even think about asking him about ptsd i just want to know if anyone else has had a similar experience and if they have any tips or words that can help me,1,4

reading made far,how do you know you have ptsd i just feel numb and sad i care about him a lot but he hasnt treated me well hes not a bad person at hearthe just has trauma i know it sounds bad but i just saw him again and he was so cute and sweet i really dont think i can cut him off we always have fun together and laugh and i have a lot of love for him but the less he responds the more i miss him reposting this because ive shared bits before but i keep going back and forth and needed to get it all out again for context were not living together right now and i think hes seeing someone else but he still hits me up when he needs help with things and i still go i hate it i feel so alone i miss when he used to want me i know it sounds crazy because he didnt treat me wellbut there was a connection some kind of real love or at least it felt like it thats what made it so hard to leave and now im just stuck im trying to process everything and meanwhile hes moved on like i meant nothing that hurts so much i dont even know where to begin i feel numb most daystrapped in my own head replaying things and now i feel so stupid because i went back to see him we spent the day together for the first time in a while and it honestly felt kind of nice familiar we laughed like we used to hes so funny charming magnetic i missed that part of him but theres always this shift that happenslike hes two different people one version i love so deeply and the other i dont even recognize later that night it changed he started making comments grabbing at me talking about how long it had been since hed had sex i tried brushing it off steering things away i just wanted to hang outnot go there again around pm i said i needed to leave i had driven three hours to see him and had a long drive ahead but then he asked me to take him minutes away to some random neighborhood to use the bathroom it didnt make sensebut i went along with it once we were there he brought me to this public restroom looked at himself in the mirror flexed then suddenly grabbed my chest over my sweatshirt told me he wanted to see i said no he laughed said just do it and i knewjust like beforei was in a situation where my voice didnt matter i didnt want to be touched i didnt want any of it but i didnt feel like i could say no without it turning into something worse so eventually i gave in he pulled his pants down i kept saying were not having sex he said he knewhe just wanted to nut he kept pushing me to take off my pants kept pressuring i kept refusing and then i gave in again when i tried to stop told him this wasnt why i came he just looked at me like he already knew i wouldnt leave we didnt have sex but he wnated to so i just waited for him to finish while i was standing there naked for min when he was done i said what are we doing can we go but he laughed it off hugged me like nothing happened he apologized said he cared but its always the same he calls it just having fun but never really hears me i think this relationship was abusive i didnt want to believe it for a long time i still feel guilty saying that i dont want to ruin his lifehes got nothing no money no stability mental health issues but i feel deeply wronged his family ignores it sometimes i feel gaslit by them too like none of it happened like im making it all up we were together five years there were sweet momentsbut a lot of dark ones too i started questioning my memory these are some things i know happened he slapped me for crying the more i cried the more he hit he shoved me into a towel rack because i threw his pants and they hit him tried to force me to drink shroom tea when i wouldnt i accidentally spilled it slapped me called me a stupid bitch stormed into my apartment ripped my shirt off me in front of my roommate destroyed the place grabbed my neck during sex left my voice hoarse said i was exaggerating wouldnt drive me to work unless we had sex called me names when i cried pinched me pulled my hair degraded me during sex if things didnt go his way hit me multiple times in the head because i accidentally hit his eye when handing him his pants pulled my hair while driving saying wed die if i left him i had a fullblown panic attack choked memore than once not for long though wouldnt let me use the bathroom during sex wouldnt let me stop even if i cried his cousin once walked in on me sobbing and naked bc he heard us fightijg and i was crying bc he kept squeezing and pinching me etc he blamed me for it theres more hed pressure me to have sex when his brother was asleep in the same room like in the bathroom when his brother was right outside humiliating stuff id say no and hed push until i gave in i think he did something sexual to me while i was halfasleep the first time i got high ill never be sure but after that he demanded sex even when i was crying sometimes he wouldnt pull outjust to feel in control he called me a slut a bitch accused me of cheating if i saw my friends he was the one cheating one time neighbors called security because of how loud he was yelling and throwing me around he screamed through the walls at them said hed kill them then he blamed me i mean all anger issues even if he didnt mean it so why do i still feel this pull i dont know i still care i still see the good parts i still hope he gets help i know hes been through stuff too but i cant ignore what happened hes homeless and probably going to find another girl to live with and im tired of feeling like it doesnt count unless someone else says it does and if i totally cut him off ill feel sad and alone and also feel like everything that happened doesnt matter thanks for reading if you made it this far,0,6

make suppress love connection said youre guy like trust december push away even harder december give stupid reasons february music taste differences justify throwing everything away sweet girl still buried suppressed emotions resurface move forward help feel safe insights would mean world,her trauma changed everythingwhy did she push me away i m need insight into my situation i was deeply emotionally connected with a woman f from august to early december our bond was strong mutual and filled with warmth affection and deep emotional safety she openly expressed how much she liked me showed me off to her friends and sister and made countless small promises about always staying close she many times said i havent ever felt this safe and this nice around a man ever she was the type of woman who never broke her promises and was very sincere and loyal however everything changed overnight on december the trauma that resurfaced a few months before we built our bond she was sexually assaulted by her uncle in mid she never explicitly told me the details but i knew it affected her deeply then on december that same uncle came to her house with guests that same day she suddenly started withdrawing before december she was affectionate and emotionally present she always wanted to talk she adored hearing my voice and she would ask me for pictures but after december she suddenly started giving reasons like i feel guilty for saying such intimate things without a proper relationship i feel like im losing myself in this were moving too fast then on december she flipped again she got upset that i didnt send her pictures said you dont care about me and when i sent them she became intimate again on december she initiated intimacy even more intensely than before but after that she pulled away again she started reinforcing the idea that i need to focus on my dreams and goals i always compromise too much when i love someone and i cant afford to do that love will hold me back from achieving what i want at the time this didnt make sense because back in november she used to say that nothing was more beautiful than growing together with someone you love so why did she suddenly start fearing that love would make her lose herself december she finally broke down i could feel something was deeply wrong so i called her on december i was overwhelmed and started crying asking for clarity at first she was cold and distant but then she suddenly broke down and cried too thats when she finally told me the truth my uncle was here when the guests came i havent felt safe since everything reminds me of him i dont want to talk to any men right now dont call me any nicknames it makes me feel uncomfortable youre the only guy i like just trust me and give me some time and space hearing this made everything click her trauma had resurfaced she had been withdrawing not because she stopped liking me but because she didnt feel safe around men anymoreincluding me i understood and gave her nothing but love and care i didnt pressure her at all i kept checking in but always in a nonintrusive safe way december she started pushing me away even more a few days later she told me you deserve someone with a better family im nothing but a burden on the man who likes me if someone else were in your place i wouldve acted the same way this hurt but i realized she was trying to protect me from her painby making me leave first still i didnt leave i continued being there for her loving and caring for her unconditionally january more family trauma emotional shutdown throughout january she was dealing with even more family issues her fathers bad behavior got worse she kept hearing disturbing stories about bad men in her family mistreating women on january her grandfather nana abu passed away at this point she became completely withdrawn she wasnt reciprocating any affection and when i asked how she was doing she would just say not good one time she even told me i feel so suicidal even when she wasnt responding i kept giving her love and care i reassured her without pressuring her february she showed warmth again after almost two weeks of total silence she came back on february she seemed a little warmer then on february and she started asking for my pictures againjust like she used to when she liked me she even sent frustrated voice notes saying you never send me pictures i want to see you so i thought maybe she was feeling safe again february everything crumbled i finally told her i love you instead of warmth she became cold and distant again she said i dont feel that way anymore were too different our music taste doesnt match were too different religiously i reassured her that differences dont matter in a relationship as long as theres love and loyalty but she didnt respond to any of my arguments instead she just doubled down then she said something that shocked me it never felt real this was the same girl who used to make her friends listen to my voice notes the same girl whose sister told me ive never seen her act this way around a man beforeits like she found a longlost love she was the same girl who would ask me to put her to sleep everynight how could she say it never felt real at that moment it was like i was talking to a completely different person postfebruary pushpull small signs of warmth after that i stopped replying for two days then she texted me where did you go then when i gave a secure response she disappeared again for five days then she came back saying i feel anxious i havent eaten i have a headache i gave her secure and distant responses then she disappeared for another seven days then she texted me one night and said she had finally made a singing page but instead of asking me for feedback like she did before she just showed me she didnt post again after that first week march faith small signs of reconnection recently after weeks of no contact i sent her a gentle voice note checking in a while later she replied with a threeminute voice note she asked about my family she thanked me for everything she said i appreciate it all so so so much she talked about ramadan faith and making dua for me this was the same girl who said in february that she was on the verge of agnosticism now she was talking about allah again my questions how did trauma make her suppress her love and connection if she said youre the only guy i like just trust me on december why did she push me away even harder on december why did she give such stupid reasons in february music taste differences to justify throwing everything away where is my sweet girl now is she still there just buried how do suppressed emotions resurface how do i move forward how do i help her feel safe again any insights would mean the world to me,1,5

and my loved ones make me feel guilty about standing up for myself it has become a patter but around covid was the worst part growing up my dad was abusive in so many ways my siblings supported each other about the abuse but they were not supportive towards me they resented me because they felt like i was not as abused as they were but his abuse with me was only when it was me and him i was five and easily manipulated believing him when he made me believe that he had a right to do it until i was and told first i tried to ask to speak to a counselor at the school but for some reason the teacher was rude and asked me in front of the class why i wanted to see a counselor and expected me to answer in front of the class i decided to back down i tried to go in the counselors office before school started but the counselor yelled at me to get out of her office this scared me to go to the school for help i later learned that my dad would tell the school i was a problem child my cousin who stayed with us for a little bit but she abruptly left she told her caseworker how my dad abused her and is so a caseworker came to talk to me at school it was the first time i was heard so i told her everything they took us out and arrested him my siblings were so hateful towards me saying i ruined the family as an adult my dad was living at our favorite grandmas and everyone would go over there i was expected to act like everything is okay he got out when i was and was forced to visit and he wanted a hug from me but i didnt want to everyone was circled around me yelling at me to hug him like i was the problem i was lied to and did not know i was going to see him he just got out of jail and i was not ready i was always uncomfortable at the way he looked at me and i tried to express it but my sister said it was because of the shirt i was wearing this was the same sister that i told first about the abuse that told me she would protect me and turned on me my brother was always abusive as well when my dad left but my sisters always took his side and said it was because my dad abused him he was the worse to me and would ostracize me from the other siblings my best friend who i would always vent to about his abuse had a huge crush on him despite his abuse and would always stand up for him because of the crush i ended the friendship a year ago when she drunkenly taunt me and laughed like it was nothing saying she would go and sleep with him behind my back after i was venting about his cruelty she would always use the phrase that she is playing the devils advocate when she stood up for him right before covid i became my other grandmothers caregiver i didnt mind caring for her despite how scary it was for me they knew i would be working a full time job and they expected it it was under the agreement they would help and they would have someone helping and i would have days off my first supportive day off my sister caught a wind of it and was mad about it so she hikacked my day off to make my mom make me help her with her shopping it was only supposed to be a half day but she hijacked all of my to days off and i felt like i did not have a choice this was the moment i felt like i lost my mind she was supposed to help out but she bolted before this and would only show up to judge me the whole time i was helping she judged me on being a caregiver i was lucky to get an hour of sleep my family was treating me badly and i only agreed to a certain caregiver but they took advantage of my timid personality they never got the help i ended up having to move in as she needed more help instead of being grateful they treated me as i was taking advantage i had to pay rent as i was still paying rent on my place they fired the lawn guy and expected me to do the lawn and other extra house things my only job was to make sure she didnt fall but somehow found myself in this situation because they knew they could take advantage grandma was being racist towards me too the same time my job was treating me horribly and bullying me having me pick up the slack of other coworkers while they got to chat and joke with the manager i was being punished for being nice and not joining them when they were bullying the other girl that eventually quit i have speech impediment and they thought it would be funny to force me to do the announcements and they would make fun of my voice i would do my job but they would stop me to do their favorites job first to yell at me about my area my other coworker who was bullied had to go to the hospital while working while i was on vacation i came back for them to yell at me for the mess that she left behind when she had to go to the emergency room during lockdown my grandma was nice to me as there was no one else yelling in her ear about me she was nice and we had a good time i was having anxiety attacks about having to go back to that work environment always being yelled out i felt confident about talking to my grandma about my worries something about lockdown helped her despite her fears of covid one morning she surprised me and even got up on her own and made her own coffee and small breakfast she told me to tell work i cant go back because her as she told me our governor said that living with the elderly was a reasonable excuse for not going back besides my job was not letting us face masks in the beginning before lockdown and did not want to lockdown and let us go home she wanted me not to go back because they didnt care about safety i did when they called and she was happy about it but asked me to not tell the family when restrictions was lifted family came back to visit and after a week grandma became cruel she became weak and was falling more she fell when the family was there and they were helping her but they wanted to try to turn it around as me being abusive with their backhanded comments i was not getting sleep and they could not even let me take a nap my grandma told me to take a nap for them to wake me up to grab her a glass of water they were yelling me about the lawn plants sweeping the roof changing the plants they were always nagging me about when i was going back to work despite it being a lockdown these people have not worked in over years she ended up having to go to the hospital because of her fall they kept her for a couple of days but we could not be there because of covid they were bugging me to check on her instead of calling themselves because i wanted to finally sleep i called in the morning and they would call for updates they finally were sending her home and i asked if they could pick her up since i was too tired to drive and everything was blurry they were ignoring me and finally leaving me alone i finally had enough and said that if they felt i was not doing a good job with grandma they can do it themselves and i left of course they were finally able to find someone quickly to help take care of her and they rehired the lawn guy she was still too much for them and tried to guilt me saying i should come back at first it was nice with these promises then they say it would be the least i could do since i put the family through hell,5,2

unreliable like said could wanted ask help dont know anymore dont even want diagnosis anything advice dont know got everything everything makes sense hurts hard hink im sorry stupid post,i think i have ptsd i had an awful online experience with a friend about a year ago it went on from like january to late june early july and i just need advice not a diagnose or anything just advice on what to do the story i am a trans girl years old and this happened around last year i am not sure if grooming is the right word or if it even counts as much cause i was almost of legal age when this happenedy cause i was but since she was i just figured it counts but clear me up if i am wrong i hope this post will be readable and not too much of a mess something important to add first is at the same time i i came out as trans to my mother in early january and she couldnt handle it well so i was pretty depressed and everything at the same time too since then we made up but i thought it was important to add it was just a discord friend and her being extremely and utterly pushy to me telling me she loves me and god knows what pushing and pushing it into me despite knowing i havent been in a good mind back then i am neither now but thats not the point and of course i didnt feel the samehow could i ever the worst part is that a bit before that in december i told her i crushed on her im pretty sure now that i didnt i i am just usually scared of being left and alone and i think i was just trying to keep her close cause she did mean a lot to me and i blame myself a lot for telling her that and ask myself a lot if everything was my fault and i just asked for it she was kinda not the most stable person and i was scared shed do something to herself if i say anything so i just let everything happen so i didnt tell how uncomfortable and bad it made me feel except for a one time some of the things she liked to say was i cant lose you or be any less close to you or what not this went on for a bit months or more while that was going on she was also insisting i am like a sister to her which made it feel even more awful and gross but still we were friends and i was too blind and scared to say or do or actually see how wrong it was after a bit we found out she was also lying to friends of us both and just telling people different things and what not and then one day after a bit of a wake up call from friends i just kinda told her how much i hate her and blocked her one experience id like to point out was was her telling me she shed want to actually kill her grandparents she was living with them and well she just told me that out of nowhere i of course tried my best to stop and not do anything i was tired and everything just was too much and since she just hadnt stopped insisting i told her i didnt care anymore so then she said its working dont stop to then wanting to change the subject to i wish i lived in your home country and was your blood sister i exploded a bit at her and just tried to diffuse her more till eventually we just switched subjects everyones okay in the end i think but it was such a gross and awful experience with her the thing is i had to read through everything again just cause i cause i couldnt remember much from it other than it happened now and all of that was form about january i think i cant remember too much when it actually started to june last year and shes still in the back of mind i am in therapy rn due to being trans and depression i think and school stress but i havent brought it up i am quite scared to bring it up kinda my parents dont even know about what happened its just still destroying me thinking about it or her that a person like that is still out there there are so many days where i just wish i could scream her in the face how much i hate her i am still in a discord server with her cause well i dont want her stripping more fun and joy out of my life and make me exclude myself of a place i like being in although i dont know if its the right thing to do is what i said in a different post last time but i actually tried talking to my therapist last week about it and the way she just shrugged it off i didnt tell her about the part with her grandparents i felt awful and it triggered a lot ive talked with friends and had my doubts and everything about it all over the course of back then since now but the thing with my therapist last week just triggered everything ive been a mess ive been nothing but blaming myself feeling lost and betrayed everytime i think of it just writing about it my heart pumps my sleep quality the last three days was awful i could barely concentrate or study could barely do anything but think about herthe way i cant remember any detail really and everythings hazy how i start feeling numb after talking about it for a bit like right now the way my friend says i keep downplaying it and it was as bad or worse than it actually feels like and and could this be ptsd i dont have any intrusive memories or nightmares but a lot of intrusive thoughts about self harm or wanting to see her not alive anymore or other bad stuff look i i feel bad for posting about this so many people have much more traumatic and awful experiences and nothing sexual even happened but i did a few stupid online quizzes and i know they are unreliable but like out of said it could be it and i just i

needed keep living change life around even started looking places baby could live older job could get save money looking baby clothes getting baby fever honestly felt like pregnant would ok thinking baby names imagining good life would baby knew would hard especially know im mature almost glamorising head would ok id great mother even got chance confirm pregnant like literally day extreme stomach pain like worst pain id ever felt screaming within seconds id bled underwear sheets mum said really heavy period gets gave really thick pad told change could barely even walk bathroom much pain toilet parts feetus coming sobbing could literally make parts hands head stuff really traumatising probably shouldve gone hospital didnt didnt tell parents wasnt period couldnt ive since issues uterus ovaries dont know ill ever able baby im older probably best sometimes wish pregnancy worked maybe wouldve changed better know fault even got raped first place died alcohol drugs suicide attempt didnt maybe baby would still alive least wouldve control abortion letting someone adopt maybe mother wouldnt attempted suicide alcoholism wouldnt gotten worse id happy mother love kids know wouldve hard feel like wouldve figured wouldnt minded going college uni wasnt able dont even go college uk health issues maybe would full time mother right instead spending day crying bed life depressing want die feel like late tell anyone parents found theyd devastated even devastated didnt tell time feel much guilt like im murderer girl know got pregnant shes whenever see posting son feel like thats im missing son look like great life know shes probably stuggling bit different dont know still feel like im grieving want die feel crazy probably chance baby probably wouldnt allowed adopt im older mental health past guess present volunteer children though local drama group helping teach kids drama stuff love sometimes look young cousins always excited see want child one day dont think ill ever physically mentally able anymore makes depressed,my baby died and i feel like its all my fault im now and have been holding this secret for a while i first got raped at and it happened multiple times i reported it at but nothing was done by the police and my parents felt a lot of guilt for not realising it was happening then when i was i was raped again by someone else this time it was my fault because i was high and drunk at the time which i actually started doing because i was traumatised so i didnt report it because i knew the police wouldnt do anything and i knew it was my fault for being high i ended up using even more to cope with it and tried to kill myself i was saved but was in a very critical state i was in hospital for a while they actually asked if there was any chance i could be pregnant and i said no which was stupid but my parents were in the room once i got home i still drank a lot not drugs but whatever alcohol i could steal from my parents stash but after maybe a few weeks or months after i got back i started to have the classic pregnancy symptoms and got really scared and i hadnt had my period for a while so i was panicking i didnt want to tell my parents but i did jokingly ask them hypothetical questions about what theyd do in certain situations and one of them is if i got pregnant young and they said theyd be mad at me so i definitely didnt want to tell them after that i decided eventually to steal a pregnancy test i was hoping it would go away and i wouldnt have to face it so was putting it off thinking maybe i was paranoid but id stopped drinking just incase because of the suicide attempt i wasnt allowed out of the house on my own so id decided that i was going to steal it when i went to town with my friend which was a week away from when i decided this at this point tho i was fairly certain i was pregnant i mean i had a bump and had missed my period for like months at this point and lots of people even my family were saying they were worried about my weight gain but they didnt think i was pregnant they thought it was because of health issues but i decided to accept the possibility of being pregnant and maybe if i dont have an abortion things wont be that bad and maybe im supposed to have this baby to change my life around to be better for my child and i started to get in a fucked up way comforted by the thought of having a baby which i know now was stupid probably but i thought for sure this was my sign i needed to keep living and change my life around and i even started looking at places me and the baby could live once i was older and a job i could get to save up money and i was looking at baby clothes and getting baby fever honestly and i felt like if i was pregnant it would be ok and i was thinking of baby names just imagining how good my life would be with a baby i knew it would be hard and i especially know that now im more mature but i was almost glamorising it in my head that this would all be ok and id be a great mother but before i even got the chance to confirm i was pregnant like literally a day before i had extreme stomach pain like the worst pain id ever felt i was screaming and within seconds id bled through my underwear and sheets my mum said its a really heavy period she gets them she gave me a really thick pad and told me to change i could barely even walk to the bathroom i was in that much pain when i was on the toilet parts of the feetus was coming out and i was just sobbing i could literally make out parts of its hands and head and stuff it was really traumatising i probably shouldve gone to the hospital but i didnt i didnt tell my parents it wasnt just a period i couldnt ive since had issues with my uterus and ovaries so i dont know if ill ever be able to have a baby when im older probably for the best but sometimes i do wish the pregnancy worked out maybe i wouldve changed for the better and i know its my fault i even got raped in the first place and that it died because of the alcohol and drugs and suicide attempt if i didnt do that maybe the baby would still be alive or i at least wouldve been in control of having an abortion or letting someone adopt them and maybe if i was a mother i wouldnt have attempted suicide after and my alcoholism wouldnt have gotten worse and id be a happy mother i love kids i know it wouldve been hard but i feel like i wouldve figured it out by now i wouldnt have minded not going to college or uni if i wasnt able to i dont even go to college uk now because of health issues so maybe i would be a full time mother right now instead of spending all day crying in bed because my life is so depressing and i just want to die i feel like its too late to tell anyone now and if my parents found out theyd be devastated even more devastated that i didnt tell them at the time i feel so much guilt like im a murderer a girl i know got pregnant at and shes now and whenever i see her posting about her son i feel like thats what im missing out on she and her son look like they have a great life i know shes probably stuggling and is a bit different than but i dont know why i still feel like im grieving this i want to die i feel crazy but that was probably my only chance to have a baby on my own and i probably wouldnt be allowed to adopt when im older because of my mental health past and i guess present i volunteer with children though at a local drama group helping teach the kids drama stuff and they love me and i sometimes look after my young cousins who are and and they are always excited to see me i just want a child of my own one day but i dont think ill ever physically or mentally be able to anymore and that makes me so depressed,85,47

badly rumor completely destroyed life actually first time posting reason recently put exposure therapy ptsd getting better getting worse four years point actually prescribed benzodiazepines due past behavior obviously psychiatrist absolutely despised idea unfortunately last resort move get really severe panic attacks go public fear running someone going start stuff possibility getting jumped thing really regret day never called police harassment mentally fucked happened starting believe maybe evil person recently im realizing completely wrong im good person would never hurt anyone let alone heinous act ive actually struggled whole life standing bullied quite bit growing let happen take due scared stand im sorry ill get point minute im getting context one things im actually grateful happened life yet major amount damage time would methamphetamine year use using meth gained ability start somewhat standing whenever high obviously felt like shit scared stand lo behold ended earning respect lot people people unaware using actually told three people meth use finally lifetime stomped picked experiencing like respected proper boundaries set almost euphoric actual meth basically quit using realized people didnt treat thought theyd treat standing able kind start setting boundaries havent problems right im going get point post basically reached someone believed life destroying rumor finally fucking spoke im sorry cursing isnt allowed im proud obviously gigantic step forward towards recovery first time years actually spoke basically sad never ever blamed let alone didnt even come close also mentioned never entire life even kind person would something like also talked new people life stand side anyways ended conversation said needed say completely whether want believe obviously cant make youre obligated think want said wanted say im happy yeah really awesome able im proud im going honest couple hours im starting get really terrified im scared people going start messaging harassing online house want proud im really sad finally gained courage years depression severe anxiety starting turn pure regret feeling stupidity someone please please help would appreciate anything someone could give coping strategies advice anything cant sleep almost also ran lorazepam could really really use support thank,i could really use some advice right now i finally stood up for myself towards someone regarding the incident that caused my ptsd so couple years back i was falsely accused of something really horrible it starts with the letter r and this had led to me getting profusely bullied along with my car getting vandalized paint remover was thrown all over it and someone had slashed my front tire though four years have passed im still getting harassed to this day initially it was to the point where i tried to kill myself at least a dozen times obviously i am still very traumatized by what happened but and all honesty i am doing unbelievably better than i was just a year ago and i had also developed multiple very serious drug addictions the most serious ones being fentanyl dosage on this one is unknown due to me using dirty s or you most likely know them as the term blues which on daily i would use anywhere from i was told by the homeless lady i was getting them from that they were significantly strong mg daily and methamphetamine grams a day i apologize i understand my drug addictions do not have anything to do with what im going to ask but im just trying to give a clear idea on how badly this rumor had completely destroyed life so this is actually my first time posting here and reason being very recently i was put into exposure therapy because my ptsd just had not been getting better it had been getting worse over the four years and its to the point where i am actually prescribed benzodiazepines due to my past behavior obviously my psychiatrist absolutely despised the idea but unfortunately its last resort move i get really severe panic attacks when i go into public out of fear of running into someone who is going to start stuff with me or the possibility of me getting jumped the thing that i really regret to this day is that i never called the police for harassment i was so mentally fucked up from what happened that i was starting to believe that maybe i was over on evil person which just recently im now realizing i was completely wrong and im a very good person who would never hurt anyone let alone do such a heinous act ive actually struggled my whole life standing up for myself so i have been bullied quite a bit growing up and i just let it happen and take it due to me being too scared to stand up for myself im so sorry ill get to the point in just a minute im just getting some context so one of the things that im actually very grateful for that happened to my life but yet did a major amount of damage to it at the same time would be methamphetamine after my year use of using meth i had gained the ability to start somewhat standing up for myself whenever i was high i obviously felt like the shit so i scared to stand up for myself at all and lo and behold i ended up earning respect from a lot of people these people were unaware i was using i have actually only told three people about my meth use and finally after a lifetime of being stomped all over and picked on me experiencing what its like to be respected and have proper boundaries set was almost more euphoric than the actual meth itself so basically after i quit using i realized people didnt treat me how i thought theyd treat me for standing up for myself and then i was able to just kind of start setting boundaries and havent had any problems with it all right so now im going to get to the point of my post basically i reached out to someone who had believed the life destroying rumor and i finally fucking spoke up for myself im so sorry if cursing isnt allowed im just very proud of myself and obviously this is a gigantic step forward towards my recovery for the first time in years i actually spoke up for myself and i had basically sad that i never ever did what i was blamed of doing let alone i didnt even come close to doing it and i also mentioned that i had never in my entire life even been the kind of person who would do something like that i also talked about just the new people in my life and how they will stand by my side anyways i ended the conversation with i said what i needed to say completely up to you whether you want to believe or not obviously i cant make you because youre obligated to think what you want but i said what i wanted to say and im happy with it so yeah its really awesome that i was able to do this and im proud of myself but im going to be honest now that its been a couple hours im starting to get really terrified im scared that people are going to start messaging me and harassing me online or at my house i just want to be proud of myself im really sad because what i had finally gained the courage to do after years of depression and severe anxiety its starting to just turn into pure regret and the feeling of stupidity can someone please please help me i would appreciate it more than anything if someone could give me some coping strategies or just advice anything at all because i cant sleep and its am almost am i also ran out of lorazepam so i could really really use some support thank you,2,3

mindfulnessbased therapy contributes unique tools help rewire brains trauma responses combining methods personalized way individuals interrupt cycle trauma achieve lasting recovery chat gpt,trauma loops mechanisms effects and breaking the cycle what are trauma loops trauma loops refer to patterns where individuals become stuck reexperiencing past trauma through heightened stress responses in essence the body and brain continue to react to triggers as if the original danger is still present creating a selfperpetuating cycle of distress psychologically this often manifests as an unconscious repetition compulsion or trauma reenactment the tendency to repeat painful experiences or relationships reminiscent of the original trauma for example a person who was victimized in childhood might unconsciously gravitate toward similar abusive dynamics in adulthood these loops can involve intrusive memories intense emotions and maladaptive coping behaviors that reinforce the trauma over time psychological mechanisms of being stuck one key psychological mechanism behind trauma loops is repetition compulsion in which survivors unwittingly recreate aspects of their trauma this may occur through recurring nightmares and flashbacks or by entering relationships and situations that echo the original trauma freud first described this phenomenon as an attempt to master or make sense of the trauma especially when the person can not consciously process or remember it unfortunately until the trauma is resolved these reenactments keep the individual emotionally tethered to the past another factor is avoidance a common coping response that paradoxically sustains trauma loops avoiding reminders of trauma people places conversations provides temporary relief but in the long run it prevents the brain from processing the memory and learning that the danger is over over time avoidance actually reinforces the fear memory giving it more power much like holding a beach ball under water only to have it surge up stronger when released research shows that avoidance is one of the strongest predictors of persistent ptsd symptoms creating a vicious cycle where trauma memories remain frightening and unintegrated thus a survivor may feel safe by isolating themselves and numbing their feelings but this also blocks recovery and can lead to depression anxiety and further isolation neurological effects of unresolved trauma trauma loops are not just psychological they have a clear neurological basis traumatic stress can imprint on the limbic system the brains emotional center essentially rewiring survival circuits to be hyperreactive functional brain changes in ptsd often include an overactive amygdala the brains fear alarm and an underactive prefrontal cortex the area that normally regulates emotions and fear responses in a healthy response to danger the amygdala sounds the alarm and the frontal cortex soon calms it down once the threat passes in trauma survivors that brake system is weakened the amygdala remains on high alert while the rational brain asleep at the wheel fails to inhibit the panic response this neural imbalance leaves the person in a constant fightorflight mode even in safe situations brain crosssection highlighting the amygdala pink and hippocampus red in the limbic system trauma can overactivate these fear and memory centers contributing to a persistent trauma loop another brain region involved is the hippocampus which helps encode and contextualize memories under extreme stress surges of cortisol a stress hormone can damage hippocampal cells and interfere with memory processing as a result traumatic memories arent filed away as past events instead they remain raw and present continually triggering the amygdala the body fails to receive the all clear signal that the danger is over studies have found that people with ptsd often have a shrunken hippocampus and an enlarged amygdala reflecting this chronic state of alarm at the same time levels of neurotransmitters get dysregulated for instance norepinephrine adrenaline floods the system heightening fear responses while calming chemicals like gaba are suppressed in short unresolved trauma locks the brain into a loop of heightened arousal the threatdetection circuits fire too easily and too intensely and the memorylogic circuits can not reign them in impact on emotional regulation and behavior unresolved trauma profoundly affects a persons emotions and behavior the constant on alert state in the brain translates to chronic hyperarousal irritability jumpiness and difficulty regulating feelings survivors often experience sudden floods of anger or panic followed by periods of emotional numbness when the system is exhausted this erratic emotional rollercoaster can strain relationships and daily functioning posttraumatic stress disorder can produce a wide range of symptoms across multiple domains behavioral psychological mood sleep and more common reactions include flashbacks vivid reliving of the trauma nightmares intense anxiety or panic and intrusive unwanted thoughts many individuals feel hypervigilant constantly scanning for danger and easily startled by small cues an outward sign of the amygdalas overactivity others may feel chronic guilt or shame or lose interest in activities they once enjoyed as trauma hijacks their ability to experience pleasure anhedonia sleep disturbances are another hallmark insomnia or night terrors are fueled by the brains inability to fully switch off the threat response at night behaviorally people stuck in trauma loops tend to avoid triggers that remind them of the traumatic event as mentioned earlier they may withdraw from social life avoid public places or steer clear of any situation that could provoke distressing memories while avoidance is understandable it can lead to a shrinking world and reinforce the belief that those triggers are truly dangerous in some cases survivors cope through substance abuse or selfdestructive behaviors as a way to dull the pain or adrenaline coursing through their bodies unfortunately these behaviors often create new problems or even retraumatization continuing the cycle on the other hand some trauma survivors find themselves reenacting aspects of the trauma often unconsciously for instance a person who felt helpless may become aggressive or seek control in unhealthy ways or someone who was abused might enter into abusive relationships later on all of these patterns are the mind and bodys way of trying to manage unprocessed trauma but they end up perpetuating the loop until the underlying trauma is addressed breaking the trauma loop evidencebased strategies escaping a trauma loop requires interventions that help the brain reprocess the traumatic memory and restore a sense of safety in the present the good news is that a number of evidencebased therapies can effectively break these cycles by targeting both the mind and body aspects of trauma eye movement desensitization and reprocessing emdr emdr is a specialized trauma therapy that uses bilateral stimulation often guided eye movements while the patient revisits fragments of the traumatic memory this approach is thought to facilitate communication between the brains hemispheres and memory networks allowing the stuck traumatic memory to be reprocessed and integrated into normal memory over several sessions the emotional charge of the memory tends to diminish emdr has a strong research base for treating ptsd one study found that after a course of emdr the majority of patients no longer met criteria for ptsd and brain scans showed significant changes such as increased gray matter volume in areas involved in memory parahippocampal gyrus and decreased hyperactivity in fearprocessing regions thalamus another study noted improved connectivity between the brains temporal lobe memoryemotion center and the prefrontal cortex after emdr suggesting the frontal control over trauma memories was strengthened in plain terms emdr appears to rewire the trauma pathways in the brain rather than just suppressing symptoms as a result distressing flashbacks and emotions subside as the trauma loses its grip given its efficacy emdr is recommended by many trauma experts and organizations as a frontline treatment for ptsd alongside traumafocused cbt cognitivebehavioral therapy cbt cognitivebehavioral therapy is a broad approach but when tailored for trauma often called traumafocused cbt it has proven highly effective in breaking trauma loops cbt works by helping individuals process the trauma memory and alter unhelpful beliefs associated with it techniques often include gradual exposure recounting the trauma or confronting triggers in a safe therapeutic setting and cognitive restructuring identifying and challenging negative thoughts like selfblame or the world is completely unsafe this process allows the brain to distinguish past from present to learn that reminders of the trauma are not actually dangerous thereby reducing avoidance and fear studies have shown that traumafocused cbt can significantly reduce ptsd symptoms outperforming control conditions like waitlists or supportive counseling in one metaanalysis patients treated with cbt were much more likely to lose their ptsd diagnosis compared to those who received no treatment or nonspecific therapy key elements of cbts success include teaching emotional regulation skills so the survivor can tolerate remembering the event without becoming overwhelmed and correcting cognitive distortions for example replacing it was my fault with a more realistic view of the event over sessions many people experience marked relief as their brain learns to associate the trauma memory with new calmer responses instead of terror in essence cbt provides a topdown approach engaging the thinking brain to calm the emotional brain which is an essential part of exiting a trauma loop somatic experiencing bodybased therapy because trauma is as much held in the body as in the mind somatic therapies have gained recognition as powerful methods to break trauma loops somatic experiencing se developed by dr peter levine focuses on helping individuals tune into their bodily sensations related to trauma and gently release the pentup fightorflight energy the idea is that during a traumatic event people often cant complete their natural defensive responses for example being unable to fight or flee and that energy gets frozen in the nervous system se practitioners guide clients to become aware of inner sensations in a safe environment encouraging the body to organically discharge stress through subtle movements changes in breath trembling etc and return to a state of balance early research on somatic experiencing is promising findings show positive effects on ptsd symptoms and improvements in emotional and physical wellbeing in one review se was associated with reductions in hyperarousal fewer intrusion symptoms and better mood regulation clients often report feeling more connected to their bodies and safer in themselves after se essentially reclaiming the body from the trauma while the evidence base is still growing current studies suggest benefit but more rigorous trials are needed many trauma experts incorporate somatic techniques even simple practices like grounding exercises deep breathing or mindful movement can signal to the nervous system that the threat is over these bottomup approaches directly address the physiological loop of trauma calming the heart rate easing tension and restoring a sense of presence in the here and now mindfulness and meditation mindfulnessbased interventions such as mindfulnessbased stress reduction or traumainformed yoga and meditation have become increasingly popular for trauma recovery mindfulness involves training attention to stay in the present moment with an attitude of nonjudgmental awareness for someone trapped in a trauma loop mindfulness can be liberating it builds the skill of observing traumatic thoughts or sensations without automatically reacting to them over time this practice strengthens the brains capacity for emotional regulation research indicates that mindfulnessbased treatments for ptsd lead to significant symptom reductions often with medium to large effect sizes and tend to have low dropout rates suggesting that many find these approaches gentle and tolerable on a neurological level mindfulness seems to counteract traumas effects by rebalancing brain networks neuroimaging studies show that regular meditation can quiet down the amygdala and increase activation in prefrontal regions that control attention and emotion even connectivity between major brain networks disrupted by trauma like the default mode network and salience network can be improved essentially restoring communication between the thinking brain and feeling brain practically mindfulness techniques breathing exercises body scans mindful yoga etc teach survivors that it is possible to experience body sensations or memories safely without becoming overwhelmed this builds distress tolerance for example noticing my heart is racing and im remembering the trauma and simply labeling it rather than panicking can over time dissolve the power those memories have many clinicians now incorporate mindfulness alongside traditional therapy and organizations like the va have added mindfulness programs for ptsd by cultivating presentmoment safety and awareness mindfulness helps break the automatic loop between a trigger and a fullblown traumatic reaction recovery and integration expert recommendations importantly no single method fits all often a combination of approaches works best to fully break a trauma loop especially for complex or longstanding trauma trauma experts increasingly emphasize integrating both topdown therapies like cbt which engage the conscious mind and thinking and bottomup therapies like somatic work and mindfulness which engage bodily and subconscious processes this dual approach ensures that trauma is processed on all levels as dr bessel van der kolk author of the body keeps the score notes traumatic experiences are stored not only in thoughts but also in visceral sensations and implicit memory therefore combining talk therapy with bodycentered techniques can facilitate more complete healing for example a person might work with a therapist to reframe negative beliefs and attend a yoga or emdr session to release bodily tension and implicit fear such comprehensive traumainformed care helps reconnect the mind and body which trauma often dissociates over time the goal is to foster neural integration essentially linking the rational brain emotional brain and survival brain back into a coordinated whole recovery from trauma loops also involves building a sense of safety and empowerment in ones life therapeutic techniques like gradual exposure are done in a controlled supportive manner so that the individual isnt retraumatized but instead gains confidence that they can face memories and survive learning coping skills for managing flashbacks or anxiety surges and engaging in selfcare practices regular exercise maintaining routines connecting with supportive others provide a foundation that makes therapeutic processing possible experts recommend patience and selfcompassion during this journey breaking a trauma loop is not a linear process but every small step such as sleeping a bit better or not feeling panic at a loud noise that used to be triggering is progress hope and neuroplasticity perhaps the most encouraging fact is that the brain can change even years or decades after trauma the human brain retains the ability to form new connections and extinguish fear responses with proper treatment many survivors who once felt hopelessly stuck in trauma loops go on to lead fulfilling connected lives after therapy their brains no longer interpret everyday life through the lens of the past trauma instead of an automatic loop responses become flexible and adaptive appropriate to the hereandnow in summary by using evidencebased therapies to process trauma memories and calm the nervous system individuals can reclaim control over their responses the loop of recurring trauma can be transformed into a narrative of resilience where the traumatic experience no longer defines or confines the person but becomes one integrated part of their past with the right support and strategies breaking free of trauma loops is not only possible but highly likely allowing survivors to move from constant survival mode to truly living once again sources evidence and recommendations have been drawn from current trauma research and expert clinical guidelines including findings on ptsds neurological impact and studies validating effective treatments each approach emdr cbt somatic experiencing and mindfulnessbased therapy contributes unique tools to help rewire the brains trauma responses by combining these methods in a personalized way individuals can interrupt the cycle of trauma and achieve lasting recovery by chat gpt not me,1,3

crash started back frequently intensely december worst episodes day lasting several hours lots distress decided try ashwagandha attempt try relax nervous system little calm stress response etc hope improve illness also wondered whether could also help ptsd linked hyperactivity nervous systemmy brains stress response etc time stressed planned take couple weeks help period stress started mg day lot weeks felt way calmer less triggered things would usually send episodes began bad side effects bad temperature control v low blood pressure light headedness stone cold feet hands lack research thought id give stop couple days noticed much active stressed nervous system felt experiencing previously completely came back decided go im take mg day usually days think may needed godsend kind wild things used instantly trigger send hole longer weird like see trigger trigger trigger brain doesnt run away passes flashbacks flashbacks arent painfully distressing honestly dont appear even smidge much used drug meant cycled three weeks ago took day break hard lots episodes came back lots distress went back within days build system im okay breaks hard im going trial taking one day week instead avoid ish weeks long week seeing thats better overall incredible mental health im thankful tried ive able things previously couldnt im able sit film sx scene without causing hours distress dont worry much someone says something takes back hear specific word see random street sign going send hole triggers pass lighter im saying completely shiny roses things still make feel type way im completely without still nothing comparison like distress used end want enforce importance research considering herb dont necessarily recommend taking ash know people really damaging lasting negative experiences going helped lots im thankful gone,ashwagandha has really helped me heres my story im writing this to share my story and the ways starting ashwangandha has helped tremendously with my ptsd undiagnosed this story will hopefully be short and sweet here goes ive been having ptsd episodes for the last years id say but over time they have progressively got worse as they are linked to a situation that was ongoing over those years spring summer they were bad but as time went on and i became in a v happy place mentally i found them becoming less frequent october i became severely ill with my first me crash and they started back up more frequently and intensely again december they were at their worst with me having about episodes a day lasting up to several hours with lots of distress i decided to try ashwagandha now having me this was in an attempt to try and relax my nervous system a little calm down my stress response etc it was a hope to improve my illness but i also wondered whether it could also help with this ptsd with it all being linked with the hyperactivity of my nervous systemmy brains stress response etc at the time i was very stressed and so planned to just take it for a couple of weeks to help me through the period of stress i started with mg a day which was a lot only for weeks felt way calmer and less triggered by things that would usually send me into episodes but i began to have bad side effects bad temperature control v low blood pressure light headedness stone cold feet and hands and with its lack of research i thought id give it a stop a couple of days off it i noticed how much more active stressed my nervous system was how i felt and what i was experiencing previously completely came back so then i decided to go on it again this is where im at now i take between mg a day usually but up it on days i think may be needed its a godsend its kind of wild things that used to instantly trigger me send me down a hole no longer do its weird its like i can see the trigger but the trigger is just that a trigger that my brain doesnt then run away with it just passes through me the flashbacks are flashbacks that arent as painfully distressing and honestly they dont appear even a smidge as much as they used to it is a drug meant to be cycled so about three weeks ago i took a day break from it and it was hard lots of episodes came back lots of distress but as i went back on it again within a few days for it to build up in my system im okay again the breaks are hard and im going to trial taking one day off a week instead to avoid ish weeks on with a long week off seeing if thats any better but overall it has been incredible for my mental health and im so thankful to have tried it ive been able to do things i previously couldnt im able to sit through a film with a sx scene in it without it causing hours of distress i dont have to worry so much if someone says something that takes me back there or if i hear a specific word or see a random street sign that its going to send me down a hole these triggers just pass through me lighter im not saying its completely shiny roses things can still make me feel a type of way im not completely without it it is still there but its nothing in comparison to what it was like and the distress i used to be in before i end i want to enforce the importance of doing your own research if you are considering this herb i dont necessarily recommend taking ash as i know some people can have really damaging lasting negative experiences going on it but for me it has helped lots and im so thankful for having gone on it,1,1

emotionally immature deal emotions trying heal shes hindering believe needs sort help probably gone undiagnosed something causing behavior plan going contact able secure safer living situation ive come subreddit ask meantime help manage emotions destructive everybodys lives dealt similar situation help manage,ptsd and dealing with an emotionally immature parent basic rundown optional read ive been diagnosed with ptsd for a few years now and its been a hard journey to recovery ive been hospitalized countless times and have attempted suicide on multiple occasions been admited to a psychiatric ward where i was mistreated and abused while in their care causing more unnecessary trauma of which i have to still recover from and now even after years of countless therapies hospitalizations and medications it still effects me daily even though im heavily medicated i still deal with routine night terrors and panic attacks having ptsd and being diagnosed from a young age its affected me to where ive developed mannerisms and habits associated with young children this is all so accentuated by the fact that im an autistic person carrying comfort stuffed animals around with me being interested in generally young childrens media etc although i may seem childish im still very much mature and my mannerisms and disabilities do not change my age and the adult things i am allowed to do given my age still fully capable of things like consent taking care of myself working and being educated etc situation now to discuss the topic at hand i live with only my mother alongside my younger sibling and two pets one of which i independently take care of since i can remember my mothers been one of the most emotionally immature people ive ever had to deal with on a daily basis shes unable to control her emotions and is always under the impression that she is entitled to everyones time and effort she gets worked up over the most mundane of things and is always angry quite literally every situation is met with the reaction of anger fall down the stairs and hurt yourself make a simple mistake have something happen that is completely out of your control she will yell scream pout stomp her feet cry and occasionally put her hands on me obviously being diagnosed with ptsd related to domestic abuse and childhood neglect this is extremely triggering many times it causes me to have panic attacks throughout the day and im unable to properly unwind knowing that shes in my house and may throw a fit over something minor at any time however it is most embarrassing and distressing when she throws fits in public ive gotten so many looks from strangers while out in public with her as shes thrown fits in stores anytime i try to tell her that she is not emotionally mature enough to manage your own emotions and that she should definitely reach out to therapy and how its negatively affecting me and my younger sibling im always told off and yelled at about how i and the one in need of therapy because i can not properly manage my emotions around her when she is throwing fits with her recent diagnosis of ankylosing spondylitis its put a lot more stress on her and shes been lashing out a lot more often as a disabled person i can understand the mental distress and new diagnosis especially one thats so lifealtering can have on you however it should never be used as an excuse to behave the way she is behaving its gotten to a point where while she is throwing fits ive had to use gentle parenting techniques to calm her down she is my parent and i shouldnt be responsible for reparenting her specially given my current mental situation some days i can barely take care of myself because the symptoms i deal with related to ptsd and physically can not bring myself out of bed because of my physical disabilities let alone have to take care of her because shes too emotionally immature to deal with her emotions herself i am trying to heal and shes hindering that i do believe she needs some sort of help and is probably gone undiagnosed with something causing this behavior i do plan on going no contact when i am able to secure a safer living situation because of this so ive come to this subreddit to ask what should i do in the meantime to help her manage her emotions so she is not so destructive to everybodys lives and if you dealt with the similar situation what did you do to help manage,1,1

someone care,i cant forgive my family for how they treated me before or after running away i feel so alone right now i didnt really know where to post this i just kinda want someone to listen to me and give me some advice i have ptsd and bpd and from ive been drinking and vaping to cope because its so difficult to live sober because otherwise im so depressed and my traumatic flashbacks and suicidal thoughts are really bad but a few months ago was trying to cut down on the drinking so i was just having enough to not have withdrawals and to calm down rather than get blackout drunk i sometimes would but less often but while i had cut down on that i started vaping a lot more my parents started to hate me because of the vaping every time theyd come into my room it was just to lecture me and i have chronic health issues which are unrelated like the doctors have said i have a chronic illness they just dont know which one specifically but i definitely have some sort of chronic illness and ive had this since before i started vaping and drinking and doing drugs i only occasionally do drugs but my parents just came in to shout at me and whenever id have a chronic illness flare up theyd blame me vaping and drinking and id get so mad because im literally on the floor throwing up unable to walk and they see it as an opportunity to lecture me well one night a few months ago my parents were going through my bedroom and found an empty bottle of vodka in the back of my cupboard they started screaming at me and saying theyre going to cut off my money which is rightfully mine because its my disability allowance and im and when youre over you get to be in charge of your own finances they also said theyre gon na kick me out once im so i was like fuck you i want to move out now and they said i wont be able to survive on my own because im stupid so that night i packed my things and left to go stay at a hotel i had a fake id so that wouldnt have been a problem and i was planning on staying there until i could get a hold of help to live on my own with a homeless organisation the next morning which was only open at specific times when my parents realised i wasnt home like an hour after i left they called me and i did answer saying i was staying in a hotel and was going to move out they told me i have to tell them what hotel and i said i wasnt going to do that and i wasnt going to come back but i was responding so they knew i was fine and wouldnt report me as missing they wouldnt stop trying everything in their power to get me to come back saying theyre going to shut my bank account down and get something so theyre legally entitled to my money the thing is where i live i legally can move out at so this was fine the police started calling me saying i need to say where i am and i cussed them out saying i can live on my own and they said my parents were saying im vulnerable and suicidal so they have to check on my safety and i basically told them to fuck off they even got my friend and two of my older cousins to subtly ask me what hotel i was at to which i lied to them and said i was at one that was no where near where i was and when the police turned up to the one i said i was at they were angry at me for lying to them and my parents then put up facebook posts saying im vulnerable and missing and they have no idea of my whereabouts and i was so fucking pissed off because i was telling them im ok and they knew i was safe they were doing it to embarrass me the police didnt even put up anything because they knew i was fine this went viral in my area there were thousands of shares and comments and i got so many messages and calls and shit from people some of which i barely know even people who have bullied me were sharing the post being like this is so sad i hope shes found soon please talk to someoneif youre seeing this i just wanted to scream at them like bitch you beat me up and told me to kill myself minutes ago shut up when the police ended up finding me they lied and said that they were going to take me to the hospital instead of at home because i said how awful my parents are and theyre trying to financially abuse me and i can legally live on my own and would like to but they took me home anyway they were just lying when they took me home my parents were telling the police about the alcohol and how thats why theyre taking away my money and the police officer said thats for the best and encouraged their plans to legally be responsible for my money until im more stable so theyve now done that my reputation is now ruined no one wants to talk to me because im crazy everyone shit talks me probably and people have recognised me even recently i hate my parents i feel like theyve ruined my life even more they think i did it to myself but i dont think so they put a highly exaggerated post about me because i had enough of their bullshit why would i want to be around them screaming at me all day and trying to take my money to control me i needed the money for other things not just vapes and alcohol and now ill probably not be able to move out even when im since theyre in control of my fucking money now im an actor and everything and when you search up my name the first thing that comes up is a screenshot someone i dont know posted of me being missing its above my acting profile so how am i supposed to get acting jobs or even a regular job if when you search my name that comes up i did forgive them but the last week ive randomly started to get angry again more and more angry i didnt hate them for a while but this past week i havent been able to look at them without feeling so much rage ive tried reporting the url to google and they said they cant take it down now my vape and alcohol addiction has gotten worse because my life has gotten worse i feel so alone everyone hates me i just want someone to care about me,11,2

not even sure where to start my dad wasnt a great dad or even a good dad and my mom in black and white terms let it happen to a degree or engaged in some not great parenting choices herself which also left longterm damage for myself and my siblings i dont want to give too much information about what we went through but i know some context is needed for what im about to ask we were left home alone when all siblings were under the age of i wet the bed pretty regularly at age and if my parents came in and found my sheets soiled id be spanked at night id be afraid to go to sleep knowing id likely pee the bed and knowing what waited for me if i did there were a few times when my siblings helped me hide my soiled sheets my siblings and i were made to smack each other if we were found squabbling food was kept under literal lock and key i am recovering from a binge eating disorder surveillance camera in a very common common room spanked with physical objects when a hand was not sufficient i cant or wont say what but something traumatic happened when i turned and i was told it was my fault and if i didnt change my ways theyd make sure what had happened would happen to me i told the other parent and they agreed that what had happened was because of my actions and behaviors and i believed them until i was on top of this one of my parents stopped saying i love you to me for literal years when i was they said they didnt want the other parent to think they cared about anything so they could be granted a divorce no idea dont ask me the other parent really didnt say it ever so during some hard times i felt completely alone id disappear for a few days at a time to a friends house and either they didnt care or they didnt know either way i guess i went to the guidance counselor in middle school and when i got home i was in trouble and got told i could be taken away by talking to them and did i really want that among so many other things some more horrible than i can say here fast forward im and in therapy after a shit year my therapist and i agreed to give cpt a try and its been the best thing i couldve done for myselfthough by far the most difficult ive come to some pretty severe realizations with my psychs help my parents shouldnt have ever had kids they lack introspection and emotional intelligence neither parent protected their children they arent good for my mental health as theyve relied on me andor ignored me when it suited them so recently a sibling told one of my parents they see stark differences in the way they dont check on me like they do my other siblings and the way they only reach out when they need something now this parent swears they want to hear my heartaches and apologize for what theyve done but they need me to tell them so they can be aware of it ive told them i dont have anything to discuss for the moment as i was in the middle of cpt and it was too hard to confront them but i told them everything i need to deal with is upstairs in my head they act disappointed so i know they know they fucked up but i just dont know that i have the energy to have a tactful conversation of going through the top ways you guys fucked me up son i know if i have this talk they will cry silent tears and they will be very touchy and want to hug and if i were honest itd probably break them and ive only just acceptedimplemented this superficial relationship we have of play nice on the holidays and make up obligations in between i dont want to trust them with my deep feelings thoughts dreams anymore i also feel like its far too late to cut ties though i did try to emancipate myself but then one parent got their feelings hurt so i wasnt allowed to lmao shouldve done it anyway but you know hindsight and all that as well as i have nieces and nephews that are important to one parent so we will be bound one way or another i dont hate them i just dont trust them or have any desire to maintain a relationship i begged for my entire childhood and adolescence but at the same time i can understand this is very confusing for them i used to be happy go lucky and affectionate toward them i craved their love and gave it to them freely at times now they want it and i cant bring myself to pretend anymore but i also dont want to pick this parent a part with honesty to move forward tldr asshole parents one wants another chance but i am

teams actually havent worked smoothies ever lot experience food confidentially say x easier lying adding lottt breathing exercises process distracting negative thinking replacing positive thoughts validating anxiety reminding unclench jaw stomach stretching moving body needed dont let get freeze state matter took hours get ready interview took minutes haha short interview answered everything best didnt ramble felt didnt add enough let communication conveying skills speak might add later wanted tell someone dont want jinx tell friends yet fingers crossed proud happy actually followed went went caring went well wanted prove anxiety win,small win i didnt chicken out of a job interview and it went well sharing tips that reduced my anxiety i say chicken out as if vomiting sweating profusely a racing heart and blurred vision from the severe and uncontrollable overthinking isnt absolutely debilitating i have cancelled andor ghosted interviewers in the past quite a bit i have some workplace trauma that causes me extreme anxiety around authority especially when im being tested interviewed etc i need out of the toxic workplace im in so badly some days the passive ideation unbearable i dont deserve to feel that way and i will not be pushed out by someones negative judgy pickiness and pettiness heres what i did different the day prior i scrolled through my work app and email and wrote down my accomplishments over the last years basic things and detailed things about two pages i may not need it all but reminding myself what i am capable of feels good eat a comfort meal well before bedtime then do some winding down activities aromatherapy and a heated stuffed animal i watched some severance too go to bed extra early naturally if you can skip the melatonin it decreases morning dopamine so it eases my anxiety personally wake up naturally if you can aka sleep in if youre still tired rest until youre fully rested a brain and body works best fully rested but dont lay in bed not sleeping letting the anxiety consume you take that beta blocker as soon as you wake up and an extra one with dr approval to immediately start working on lowering your bp hr and help with the sweating do not hit that thc pen i swear to god it will give you a panic attack with anxiety this bad right now just wait until after the day is over i promise it will hit harder too lh srs lol schedule the interview in afternoon your stress levels are highest after waking up and i always schedule interviews early as crap no wonder i cant control it in the mornings its programmed to my body lol this way i had plenty of time to practice some distress tolerance and emotional regulation skills take a shower and do the whooole routine listen to low tempo music if you overthink in the shower i sure do cold water at the end for the tragus nerve which controls your anxiety make yourself feel fancy i wore a new pair of lashes and blowdried my hair deep flossed wore my date only perfume dress for success i went out and got a nice striped collared shirt to go with a cardigan i felt professional and better prepared not worrying about how i looked i love the motto dress better than the boss does listen to positive affirmations while getting ready especially if you struggle with negative self talk maybe some nature documentary or an antscanada video if thats not feeling the vibe i did listen to a minute meditation video on youtube positive affirmations for a job interview twice arrive early and review the job description once more along with my accomplishments i kept thinking at that point i just want to get it over with i went inside to use the bathroom then waited on the outdoor patio and let the interviewer know i was there a bit early minutes is perfect but anything earlier is way too early i was able to sit and watch minutes of an antscanada video and enjoyed the weather i didnt feel anxious anymore just a little nervous the one thing i did not do is eat a breakfastlunch but it would definitely decrease those stress and anxiety hormones i am titrating off a medication that suppresses my appetite and i was feeling too nauseas to eat so i had two nutritional shakes instead my last point is especially for those who get in their heads and deeply obsess of how youll be perceived and judged do not oversell yourself underpromise and over deliver instead it will work out better i recently had a revelation lol realizing i get uncontrollably anxious about interviews not because i dont prepare myself but because i am lying to myself i try to overestimate my capabilities but its obvious because im not confident saying it i dont know everything on that job description i dont feel confident running a store with employees i dont enjoy late nights but i do love math and doing inventory i love engaging with the community involving businesses with clubs and schools i like training and developing teams i actually havent worked with smoothies ever but i do have a lot of experience with food i can confidentially say all of that x easier than lying about it adding i did a lottt of breathing exercises during all of this process distracting myself from any negative thinking and replacing it with other positive thoughts while validating the anxiety i was having reminding myself to unclench my jaw and stomach stretching and moving my body when i needed to dont let yourself get into that freeze state no matter what it took me hours to get ready and the interview only took minutes haha it was a short interview but i answered everything as best as i can i didnt ramble when i felt i didnt add enough i let my communication conveying my skills speak for itself i might add to this more later but i wanted to tell someone about it i dont want to jinx it and tell my friends yet fingers are crossed but i am very proud and happy i actually followed through and went i went into it not caring if it went well or not i just wanted to prove to myself i can do it and that my anxiety will not win for once d,6,1

never end up clicking with me i give people a lot of time to see if we gel together but so far nothing i like people who spam text and will bother me just like how i like to text my every thought lol otherwise it feels so bland it doesnt help that i have very limited interests and strange ones at that the answer i get is ok so look for groups based around that no duh thats what ive been doing i reach out to people who dont respond i have a chat and things go nowhere it just doesnt work the few nice people i meet are people who have no interest in what i like sometimes even disliking those things im autistic and my hyperfixations are very important im not able to pretend to care about other shit honestly im a very readable person i want to bond over shared interests and experiences ill get random messages from people saying hi but one word responses are my worst nightmare at this point then theyll end up having nothing in common and i wonder why they reached out at all im very talkative expressive downright annoying and i need something like that in a friend someone who isnt obsessed with me but someone who can ramble with me about nothing and everything at all once upon a time i had a best friend moreso a twin we were even briefly married for a while but we were both too toxic to make it work and they remained abusive were both going nocontact sometimes i just wan na run back and beg them to take me back because at least i know theyre a good friend i know that ill always feel at home and understood by them we have every interest in common were basically twins and nobody else feels the same i know i wont find that same experience again but i need something like that im tired of shallow surface level stuff with people who cant relate and cant be related to i feel like a goldfish in a bowl a bird whos stuck in a cage and longs to fly with its friends i just miss having someone to talk to about anything i only text my brother and he cant really do much besides try to support me but man i miss rambling about shit to people i have a lot of pent up emotion and i want to be listened to and not just tolerated i want someone who can at least try to understand what im talking about the only other option is making friends outside of the house im not in college yet but even visiting campus scares me with all the people even when ive taken an edible which usually takes all the edge off im reading a lot of posts about how people cant make friends in college and im so afraid i wont be able to either theres clubs but theyre super lame the only one even remotely relatable is the anime club but i dont even like anime besides jojos i just know ill find other neurodivergents there but thatll make me anxious too since my amygdala cant tell friend from foe right now i cant even go into the building without beginning to panic meds dont help either for the same reason i cant go to conventions or meet ups because of the social anxiety even when im not blacked out or practically seizing im still afraid and nervous logically i know i have nothing to worry about but the insecurity goes so deep all i see are people who have well established social hierarchies and have their own special places in their cliques their found families and im never part of that even when i try to be im friendly im approachable i make an active effort to interact with others online and irl but nobody wants me i even try to hide how lonelydepressed i am so i dont scare anyone away sometimes im a bit awkward or uh blatantly autistic but most of the time i just want to make people laugh and do random shit with people i want to have one of those friendships like in s movies i want a squad like that social media hasnt helped me become social either i met my ex on instagram by chance so ive been trying to recreate those circumstances but so far nothing this has been bothering me for years and all i can do about it is cry and keep going through life dead inside

even really parents examples first signs family occasions manageable felt relatively safe know like recurring thing people young congratulation people even family members started become anxious still something avoid lead weird faces socially expected thing uncomfortable theres many things even mention still avoiding due social anxiety became deeply ingrained basically became social anxiety basically ignored denied avoid anxiety already like exposure therapy hll rather chop hands besides wasnt aware medical treatment back started self medicating first drug addictions cigarettes age xtc age became quickly severely addicted benzodiazepines years old followed slowly progressing deadly substance use disorder something also didnt help im gay came age grateful lucky accepting people still socially vry uncomfortable times due addiction core problem faded even though feelings anxiety remained years using different drugs medications illegal kinda tried survived way trough life using substances avoiding much possible around twenties severely addicted ghb leading several clinical detoxifications addiction healthcare outpatient treatment inpatient treatment therapist etc counselor back found remarkable concerning specifically chose drugs like benzos ghb downers suppressing feelings anxiety provided day physiological evaluation suspected adhd one underlying causes indeed diagnosis adhd add diagnosed although adhd symptoms lessened managed finished education life became bit easier diagnosis wasnt core problem discovered phenibut started using kind medication drugs especially since covid addiction progressed phenibut benzodiazepines methamphetamine became extreme realised social anxiety disorder weeks ago im sober half year substances made see things clearer realise many things avoiding due anxiety calling boss congratulating someone birthdays dating concerts dont fun things life make suffer im referred specialised mental health care recently get anxiety evaluated diagnosed im feeling hopeful stress horror ive disorder really hope find sme rest start work issue thats,how the pieces fall into place after years of addiction this is my story i am a yo guy living in the netherlands i suffer from social anxiety for as long as i can remember however it took me years to get back to the core problem mainly because of addiction that started young and has been progressing badly i always felt anxious and stressed for social events or tensed but i never really said it to anyone because the last thing i want is to become the center of attention right at least thats what i think has always been the reason i never spoke about my feelings when i was very young not even really to my parents some examples that i have that were the first signs were family occasions but they were manageable because it felt relatively safe you know its like a recurring thing with the same people when i was young congratulation people even family members started to become very anxious and still is something i avoid which can lead to weird faces because its a socially expected thing to do but s uncomfortable theres too many things to even mention here that i have and still am avoiding due to social anxiety but it became so deeply ingrained that i basically became that social anxiety i basically ignored and denied it to myself to avoid any more anxiety than i already had like exposure therapy hll no i d rather chop my hands off besides i wasnt aware of any medical treatment back then i started self medicating after my first drug addictions cigarettes at age of xtc at age i became quickly and severely addicted to benzodiazepines at years old what followed was a slowly progressing but deadly substance use disorder something that also didnt help is that im gay i came out at age of and grateful and lucky with how accepting people were and are but still it can be socially vry uncomfortable at times due to my addiction the core problem faded and even though the feelings of anxiety remained over the years using different drugs and medications all illegal i just kinda tried to survived my way trough life using substances and avoiding as much as possible around my twenties i was severely addicted to ghb leading to several clinical detoxifications and addiction healthcare outpatient treatment inpatient treatment therapist etc my counselor back then found it remarkable and concerning that i specifically chose drugs like benzos and ghb which are all downers and suppressing feelings of anxiety they provided my a day physiological evaluation because they suspected adhd as one of the underlying causes and indeed the diagnosis was both adhd and add i was when diagnosed but although my adhd symptoms lessened and i managed to finished my education and life became a bit easier that diagnosis wasnt the core problem i discovered phenibut and started using all kind of medication and drugs especially since covid my addiction progressed phenibut benzodiazepines and methamphetamine it became very extreme i just realised about my social anxiety disorder few weeks ago im sober for half a year from most of the substances which made me see things clearer and realise how many things i am avoiding due to my anxiety from calling my boss to congratulating someone birthdays dating concerts i dont do all the fun things in life because they make me suffer im referred to specialised mental health care recently to get my anxiety evaluated and diagnosed im feeling hopeful after all the stress and horror ive been through because of this disorder i really hope that i will find sme rest and start to work on this issue thats it for now,9,1

talk one last time sort everything like evry think cuz person close even though many different friends special yeahh coming back hat focussing monk mode problem like due parents also cuz like im th still didnt buy phone like always behind life like im talking dont give privacy like restrictive like shouldnt even talk girl house small room thats evryone around privacy like zero whenever text smile like girl keep scolding got point fed also reason ideactivated insta basically im introvert dont much communcation skills im thinking activate insta like years ik many ppl text text many close lost contact tis process really say ask deactivated insta cuz dont wan na sound corny embarasses helpme,just need some advice i just im in a fucked up situation rn and i really need help cuz now idk what i should do so basically i had this girl bestie and we were very very close for like years it was like we couldnt spend a day without talking to each other from morning through night whether it be texts or calls we used to talk for hours and hours so i basically messed up things like years ago in so she was basically my junior and we were in same school till th and after that i moved to a different college but still our closeness was the same but then around september idk what got into my head but i was like i want to focus on myself and like do a side hustle and all that shit and then i watched this fucking monk mode stupidity and took it serusly so i planned to deactivate my insta but i didnt inform or talk about with her so at first i just thought ill just deactivate my insta for a month and then even if ntg happens ill just activate it again insta was the only way we used to talk i never had her number there is a reason for it just focussing on myself and monk mode wasnt the only reason so i just deactivated my insta and just left off so the next few days she started calling me but i just ignored her idk and dont remember why i should had talked about it so yeah i didnt pickup her calls this went for a month and then she texted me in whatsapp to w hich i ignored again cuz it was like a month now but idk why but i didnt activate my insta cuz i was lke scared ig idk how to tell but i was lke i couldnt face her like what am i gon na say to her all i did for the whole month was just timepass so i thought just lets keep it for one more month and after that months passed and yeahh after that whatsapp text she never tried contacting me i mean yeahh no matter how cloe u are to anyone you would reach them out till a time period and after that u will just give up and yeah she tried contacting me for like monthsthats a very long time ppl dont do that for their ex also but she kept trting to contact me and me a fucking stupid idiot just kept avoiding her cuz i was like idk what should i say to her like this monk mode and i was focusing on myself sit i thought it was corny and she would judge me for that and so i kept avoiding her but deep down i always wanted to talk and sort it out and yeahh after those months she never texted or called after that and that months passed and it turned to more than a year now it was like my only insta id and everytime i was like kk i will login evrytime i just think up about her and what will i say to her if she texts me what and i didnt know how to face her as i said the reason earlier was like to focus and all monk ode was just too corny i thought to avoid but now i just cant keep up like how long ami gon na continue this and now if i dont talk and sort it out doesnt matter if she even forot me and moved on but i wan na just talk to her for one last time and sort everything out its like evry now and then i think about her cuz she was the only person who was that close to me even though i have many different friends she was special to me and yeahh coming back that why not hat focussing on myself and monk mode was the only problem it was like due to my parents also cuz its like im in th and they still didnt buy me a phone they like are always behind my life like who im talking to what it is about and all they just dont give me privacy its like they are too restrictive and like i shouldnt even talk to a girl our house is small just room and thats it so evryone is just around and no privacy like zero so whenever i text and smile they are like who is it is it a girl and they keep scolding me and all and it got to a point where i was fed up with it and it was also a reason that ideactivated my insta basically im an introvert and i dont have much communcation skills so im thinking to activate my insta after like years and ik many ppl will text me and i have to text many who i was close and lost contact in tis process but what should i really say them when they ask why i deactivated my insta cuz i dont wan na sound corny or embarasses so just helpme,1,0

incitement weve been seeing a worrying increase in prosuicide content showing up here and and also going unreported this undermines our purpose here so we wanted to highlight and clarify our guidelines about both direct and indirect incitement of suicide weve created a wiki that covers these issues we hope this will be helpful to anyone whos wondering whether somethings okay here and which responses to report it explains in detail why any validation of suicidal intent even an innocent message like if youre committed ill just wish you peace is likely to increase peoples pain and why its important to report even subtle prosuicide comments the full text of the wikis current version is below and it is maintained at rsuicidewatchwikiincitement we deeply appreciate everyone who gives responsive empathetic nonjudgemental support to our ops and we particularly thank everyone whos already been reporting incitement in all forms please report any post or comment that encourages suicide or that breaks any of the other guidelines in the sidebar to the moderators either by clicking the report button or by sending us a modmail with a link we deal with all guideline violations that are reported to us as soon as we can but we cant read everything so community reports are essential if you get a pm that breaks the guidelines please report it both to the reddit sitewide admins and to us in modmail thanks to all the great citizens of the community who help flag problem content and behaviour for us rsuicidewatchwikiincitement summary its important to respect and understand peoples experiences and emotions its never necessary helpful or kind to support suicidal intent there are some common misconceptions discussed below about suicidal people and how to help them that can cause wellmeaning people to inadvertently incite suicide there are also people online who incite suicide on purpose often while pretending to be sympathetic and helpful validate feelings and experiences not selfdestructive intentions were here to offer support not judgement that means accepting with the best understanding we can offer whatever emotions people express suicidal people are suffering and were here to try to ease that by providing support and caring the most reliable way we know to deescalate someone at risk is to give them the experience of feeling understood that means not judging whether they should be feeling the way they are or telling them what to do or not do but theres an important line to draw here theres a crucial difference between empathizing with feelings and responding nonjudgmentally to suicidal thoughts and in any way endorsing encouraging or validating suicidal intentions or hopeless beliefs its both possible and important to convey understanding and compassion for someones suicidal thoughts without putting your finger on the scale of their decision anything that condones suicide even passively encourages suicide it isnt supportive and does not help it also violates reddits sitewide rules as well as our guidelines explicitly inciting suicide online is a criminal offense in most jurisdictions do not treat any ops post as meaning that will definitely die by suicide and cant change their minds or be helped anyone whos able to read the comments here still has a chance to choose whether or not to try to keep living even if theyve also been experiencing intense thoughts of suicide made a suicide plan or started carrying it out in the most useful empirical model we have the desire to die by suicide primarily comes from two interpersonal factors alienation and a sense of being a burden or having nothing to offer these factors usually lead to a profound feeling of being unwelcome in the world so any acceptance or reinforcement of suicidal intent even something innocent like i hope you find peace is actually a form of covert shunning that validates a persons sense that theyre unwelcome in the world it will usually add to their pain even if kindly meant and gently worded how to avoid validating suicidal intent keep the following in mind when offering support to anyone at risk for suicide people who say they dont want help usually can feel better if they get support that doesnt invalidate their emotions unfortunately many popular good responses are actually counterproductive in particular many friends and family tend to rely exclusively on trying to convince the suicidal person that its not so bad and this is usually experienced as i dont understand what youre going through and im not going to try people whove had help that made them feel worse dont want any more of the same it doesnt mean that someone who actually knows how to be supportive cant give them any comfort most people who are suicidal want to end their pain not their lives its almost never true that death is the only way to end these peoples suffering of course there are exceptional situations and we certainly acknowledge that for some people the right help can be difficult to find but preventing someones suicide doesnt mean prolonging their suffering if we do it by giving them real comfort and understanding an unfixable problem doesnt mean that a good life will never be possible we dont have to fix or change anything to help someone feel better its important to keep in mind that the correlation between our outer circumstances and our inner experience is weaker and less direct than commonly assumed for every kind of difficult life situation you will find some people who lapse into suicidal despair and others who cope amazingly well and a whole spectrum in between a key difference is how much inner resilience the person has at the time this can depend on many personal and situational factors but when theres not enough interpersonal support can both compensate for its absence and help rebuild it we go into more depth on the it gets better issue in this psa post which is always linked from our sidebar community info on mobile guidelines there are always more choices than brutally forcing someone to stay alive or passively letting them end their lives to avoid accidentally breaking the antiincitement rule dont say or try to imply that acting on suicidal thoughts is a good idea or that someone cant turn back or is already dead do whatever you can to help them feel cared for and welcome at least in this little corner of the world our talking tips offer more detailed guidance look out for deliberate incitement it may come in disguise often comments that subtly encourage suicidal intent actually come from suicide fetishists and voyeurs unfortunately this is a real and disturbing phenomenon people like this are out there and the anonymous nature of reddit makes us particularly attractive to them they will typically try to scratch their psychological itch by saying things that push people closer to the edge they often do this by exploiting the myths that we debunked in the bullet points above specifically you might see people doing the following encouraging the false belief that the only way suicidal people can end their pain is by dying there are always more and better choices than brutally forcing someone to stay alive or helping actively or passively them to end their lives creating an artificial and toxic sense of solidarity by linking their encouragement of suicide to empathy they will represent themselves as the only one who really understand the suicidal person while either directly or indirectly encouraging their selfloathing emotions and selfdestructive impulses since most people in suicidal crisis are in desperate need to empathy and understanding this is a particularly dangerous form of manipulation many suicide inciters are adept at putting a benevolent spin on their activities while actually luring people away from sources of real help a couple of key points to keep in mind skilled suicide intervention peer or professional is based on empathic responsiveness to the persons feelings that reduces their suffering in the moment contrary to popculture myths it does not involve persuasion dont do it cheerleading youve got this or meaningless false promises trust me it gets better or invalidation let me show you how things arent as bad as you think anyone who leads others to expect these kinds of toxic responses or any other response that prolongs their pain from expert help may be covertly prosuicide of course people sometimes do have bad experience when seeking mentalhealth treatment and its fine to vent about those but processing our own disappointment and frustration is entirely different from trying to destroy someone elses hope of getting help choices made by competent responders are always informed by the understanding that breaching someones trust is traumatic and must be avoided if possible any kind of involuntary intervention is an extremely unlikely outcome when someone consults a clinician or calls a hotline confidentiality is addressed in more detail in our hotlines faq post the goal is always to provide all help with the clients full knowledge and informed consent we know that no individual or system is perfect mistakes that lead to bad experiences do sometimes happen to vulnerable people and we have enormous sympathy for them but anyone who suggests that this is the norm

is an amputee grandpa has some type of memory disorder i feel worthless guilt ridden pathetic as the title states i dont even really know how to start this i was born premature months i had to be on medicine and oxygen for the first few months of my life i grew up as the youngest of a brother and two sisters my mother was a drug addicted xanax and pain pills probably more im dumb and naive and my father was emotionally absent and always enabling my mother i was taken away away a child and given to my stepgrandma and my grandpa i lived with them happily for a little more than a year before being given back whenever covid kid in i have lived here ever since when i lived at my grandparents as a kid i was a happy kid i had friends i guess i was also so that helps too but once i was given back i was neglected hard i forgot about my homework my hygiene i moved schools and none of the kids really liked me because i was weird i didnt have any friends i escaped to the internet and i would talk to older men i was a god awful child i acted out i was a pathological liar i wanted attention any way i could it was awful when i was i met a man on grindr he was i lied to him i told him i was of age and we had sex he learned a week or two after that i was in fact a child but he didnt want to stop so we contuined this relationship still hasnt ended i am still in contact with him to this day we just officially broke up a month ago but im such a people pleaser i cant help but go over there and please him i can not hurt his feelings the guilt kills me fuck the guilt its the main reason i think i want to end it all i have so much guilt about everything in my life i can not disappoint anyone everyone must like me and i must make everyone happy if i dont then then theyll hate me i hate telling people no or literally just needing to leave someones house or lunch or whatever it may be i also have some weird kinks im not dealing with those here i also have some weird survivors guilt about living through my birth it sounds fucking ridiculous i feel like ive done nothing in the past years ive started smoking weed around i still do i do nothing on my days off besides get off watch youtube and cry im a worthless loser i barely graduated high school ive tried to go to college i went two semesters and just disappointed myself i dont believe i add anything meaningful to the world i have a few friends who i speak to weekly i dont think my death would really impact them though i dont want it to i want to just die and have everyone forget that i ever even existed thats the way it shouldve been fucking years ago i also have somehow convinced myself that maybe if i did die as a newborn that maybe my mom wouldve not have been such a stupid bitch she wouldve gotten clean stopped abusing her other children she couldve been an actual good mother thats just wishful thinking though a month or two ago she told me that i was a waste of human life and that she was going to get her name removed from my birth certificate its crazy hearing your own mother say that to you after years of telling you up and down how much of a miracle you were and how much of a gift you were i dont think about my parents much really i dont think theyre really the reason for me wanting to kill myself they havent helped though i know that their neglect has fucked me up in so many ways again why did i get to live is it just some sick fucking cruel joke ive had many near death experiences i think my sister always tells me a story about how since my mom was a nurse she got to take me home early from the nicu one day presumably after popping a few pills she laid down with me in her arms after she turned the alarms off of all of my machines yk the ones keeping me alive she fell asleep and my sister had to wake her up my oxygen mask had fallen off ive gotten deathly ill with the flu when i was both and i flipped my car when i was i remember being so close to the concert if i was just going a bit faster then i wouldve hit my head and probably died on impact fuck its like a dream i always think about those times and i ask myself has my life gotten any better and the answer is always no it hasnt lets circle back to the man from grindr m m took my virginity he was my very first everything i devoted everything to him he was my first love and best friend but as i literally grew up i kinda realized how bad it was for both of us how wrong it was i feel guilty for it taking so long for it to hit me he doesnt understand he can not wrap his head around it and hes so fucking depressed sbout it and its also making me depressed i dont want to hurt him i love him and want to make this as easy as possible but ive never done anything like this before i dunno ive felt this way since i was ive always wanted to leave my first attempt was at i believe the second at the third time and first time i got hospitalized was at i havent been back since and havent tried since then i started to cut myself whenever i was im just so tired i know people rely on me mostly my grandparents ive been trying to hold off for them its hard though i feel selfish thinking about it and wanting it so bad once again i wish i died as a newborn i wouldnt of had to grow up and be here an actual conscious person i hate it all i fucking hate it and this this is the peak of pitifulness crying to a bunch of

symptoms get go therapy shes meltdowns lives hour away correctly help,gf is giving active signs of suicide and shes bound to move in by friday what do im do all right were from venezuela i live in the capital she lives in a neighbor city about an hour away for context shes lived her whole life there and its rough no running water power outages bad internet a lot of poverty she also doesnt have a lot of support from her family and is very poor her father died a year and a half ago and he was the main provider for the household despite her being the youngest of and of her siblings living abroad in latin america shes the only one who works to help maintain the household shes had to help her mom and even her nephews her sisters bully her a lot because shes different as in she wants to leave the country for europe sought an education etc add to the fact that shes suspecting shes on the spectrum and youve got a nasty situation ever since last year shes been very open about wanting to kill herself i dont know what to do and i need help today she had a mini meltdown because her bank account got blocked for me this would be an annoyance since the banks here force you to go to them and wait a long time to solve the issue in a city where theres a lot of crime and bad public transportation but this triggered an episode where she again dumped all of her past trauma how her situation is hopeless and that she wants to kill herself so that she may not have any more problems she regularly isolates herself when this happens and is very difficult to get her to talk she says its because she feels like shes drowning and cant talk properly i believe her but since we only see each other every two weeks its difficult to comfort her and be reassuring via phone what do i do this is whats going to happen in the next few days and im a bit scared weve been together for five years my gf has gone to therapy in the past and it made her feel a lot better but this was before her father died she says she doesnt want to go because she feels its pointless to help her and because her therapist rightly said maybe the solution was to find strategies to help her endure her environment for a while why do i say rightly because shes going to move in with me i honestly think a lot of her monetary troubles will go away because shes going to be far away from her family her sister is going to move in with her mom and will now have to take care of her she will live a lot closer to her job and my apartment has normal running water electricity etc i earn a lot of money for this country anyway and i do feel a big part of her troubles are economic family related originally my plan was to help her finally move in and then use the opportunity to comfort her better by actively listening hugging her etc and then use that as a trampoline for get to go to therapy but now im afraid shes been isolating herself a lot more and being very open about her desires to commit suicide it feels as if a part of her brain detected that shes finally going to be able to be happy or at least live a stable live and is now actively sabotaging her before she can do that since the end of the pandemic ive know people who killed themselves by hanging and this is my fear i fear entering the bathroom and finding her there dead now i work from home unlike her and i do believe in hope and the idea that she may indeed get better from a stable environment but i dont know if im doing the right thing can you guys help me what else should i be doing or is this right way tl dr gf is sucidal in large part because shes poor and has a shit family bf me thinks that by helping her move in she can get a stable environment which can alleviate the symptoms until i get her to go to therapy but shes having meltdowns and lives over an hour away am i doing this correctly help,1,0

stranger didnt report or anything because i figured no one would really listen an accurate sense given what i know about the law from law school hooked up with a classmate in february and he backhanded me out of nowhere and gave me a concussion also didnt report per the above point on failures in the law per the above experiences plus ex fiance plus situationship general sense that im

whoever finds me but spares my roommates that specific trauma alternative if i wimp out bridge in my city get so drunk im not afraid to jump higher likelihood of failure on this one thoughts also to be clear i know suicide is a permanent solution to a temporary problem i also know that suicidality is more frequently the experience of wanting to be painfree rather than wanting to be dead i dont really see a real way to be painfree other than this hence the post im a rational adult person and i dont really want highly emotional poetic responses about the meaning of life,2,10

1jirkjx,1742825478.0,feel depressed even suicidal break hello years old women facing difficult situation breakup relationship boyfriend two years end november decided break said wasnt sure feelings thought would better way since dark thoughts chest pain insomnia crying almost every day feeling anxious desperate feel like life meaning anymore sometimes think would better everything ended cant seem get past moment went psychiatrist took medication anxiety xanax gradually reduced stopped told could addictive feel even worse treatment stopped point hard even ask help doctor dont feel like want anymore happened summer also broke got back together afterward cheated time sadness anxiety chest pain disappeared never imagined would situation would break strong urge talk try discuss possible reconciliation thought makes feel even scared anxious fear rejects might take life cant live uncertainty keep hoping something might never happen im also afraid face reality weeks ago even tried hurt thing stopped thought maybe would want get back together wouldnt anymore hard even think family dogs way feel rather always feeling way would better suffering ended im trying survive one day next feeling restless nightmares insomnia difficult also tried going therapy currently seeing psychologist dont see improvement hard find anything positive happened realize permanent problem sometimes think permanent solution permanent problem stop existing dont know else fix situation cant move forward cant get time objectively speaking bad things happened relationship rather feeling way would rather lived things wasnt one chose break cheating fact using dating apps told wasnt sure truly loved sometimes preferred go drinking friends instead spending time feel terrible knowing let whatever wanted never set boundaries never reproached anything yet still chose feel like fault treated way horrible ugly undesirable person someone else would never done things,i feel depressed and even suicidal after my break up hello i am years old women and i am facing a very difficult situation after a breakup i was in a relationship with my boyfriend for two years and at the end of november he decided to break up with me because he said he wasnt sure about his feelings for me and thought it would be better this way for now since then i have been having dark thoughts chest pain insomnia crying almost every day and feeling very anxious and desperate i feel like my life has no meaning anymore and sometimes i think it would be better if everything just ended i cant seem to get past this moment i went to a psychiatrist and took medication for anxiety with xanax which was gradually reduced and then stopped because i was told it could be addictive but i feel even worse now that the treatment has been stopped at this point its very hard for me even to ask for help from the doctor i dont feel like i want to anymore this happened to me before in the summer when he also broke up with me but we got back together afterward because he had cheated on me at that time all my sadness anxiety and chest pain disappeared i never imagined i would be in this situation again and that we would break up once more i have a very strong urge to talk to him and try to discuss a possible reconciliation but this thought makes me feel even more scared and anxious because i fear that if he rejects me again i might take my own life i cant live with this uncertainty and keep hoping for something that might never happen but im also afraid to face reality a few weeks ago i even tried to hurt myself and the only thing that stopped me was the thought that maybe he would want to get back together and i wouldnt be here anymore its very hard for me even when i think about my family and my dogs but in a way i feel that rather than always feeling this way it would be better if my suffering ended im trying to survive from one day to the next feeling restless having nightmares and insomnia but its so difficult i ve also tried going to therapy and i am currently seeing a psychologist but i dont see any improvement its so hard for me to find anything positive in what has happened and i realize this is a permanent problem sometimes i think that the only permanent solution to a permanent problem is to stop existing i dont know what else i can do to fix the situation because i cant move forward and i cant get over it at the same time objectively speaking there were some bad things that happened in our relationship but rather than feeling this way i would rather have lived with those things because i wasnt the one who chose to break up his cheating the fact that he was using dating apps and that he told me he wasnt sure if he truly loved me and that sometimes he preferred to go out drinking with his friends instead of spending time with me i feel so terrible knowing that i let him do whatever he wanted that i never set any boundaries that i never reproached him for anything and yet he still chose to do this to me i feel like its all my fault that he treated me this way because i am a horrible ugly and undesirable person and that if i were someone else he would never have done these things,2,0

ended taking time eventually fired felt like lost purpose life parents tried take church see would help whole repurposed program spent days weeks staying home sleeping time trying kinds different antidepressants thinking would magically fix didnt tried almost common ones prozac zoloft wellbutrin nothing worked get back old self time wasnt anything life even try get better seemed wanted meds work never fault mine mental hell im daily fault time feels like passing im barely even trying college family amazing take great care given everything ive ever wanted life yet reason still cant help feel empty inside like lost soul fire life living ive chasing drugs thinking theyre going fix cant fix cant fix guess getting refill ativan today im going take shit ton kill get high cause ive slowly started realize dont give fuck ive lying parents every single day almost everything went ambien binge whole week actually great escape couldnt get away hate everyone says im great person im loving caring everyone dont see dont know hell im ever going see im mg zoloft feel like fucking zombie like shell rely heavily others bidding second try think think anything ruminating nothing feel insane amount anxiety fear pills wont fix know know running feel wont fix either feel careless quite honestly dont care fall asleep never wake used fear god fear death point ive asking god take sleep every night feels like cant get head matter hard try nothing feels real feel like im control life like something someone living im addicted making miserable change feels impossible point im ranting ive already tried talking parents friends feels like nothing helping ever wan na sleep pain doesnt even affect anymore find ive become extremely desensitized every day life live head im almost point want end give else even get better even dont care make get better,almost at that point i think years ago i took finasteride and havent been the same since i took this drug trying to get my hair back and faintly remember feeling extreme anxiety and depression weeks later i had a mental breakdown at my job at the time and ended up taking time off until eventually they fired me i felt like i lost my purpose in life my parents tried to take me to church to see if it would help and we did a whole repurposed program there i spent days and weeks staying home sleeping all the time and trying all kinds of different antidepressants thinking they would just magically fix me they didnt i tried almost all of the common ones prozac zoloft wellbutrin nothing worked to get me back to my old self and at the same time i wasnt doing anything for my life to even try and get better it seemed i wanted the meds to do all the work but they never did and its not their fault its mine this mental hell im in daily is my fault time feels like its just passing me by and im barely even trying in college my family is amazing they take such great care of me and have given me everything ive ever wanted out of life and yet for some reason i still cant help but feel so empty inside its like i lost my soul and my fire for life and living ive been chasing drugs thinking theyre going to fix me but they cant fix me if i cant fix myself i guess i should be getting my refill of ativan today and im going to take a shit ton not to kill myself but to just get high cause ive slowly started to realize that i just dont give a fuck about myself ive been lying to my parents every single day about almost everything i went on an ambien binge for a whole week and it was actually a great escape but i couldnt get away from myself i hate myself but everyone says how im such a great person and how im so loving and caring about everyone i just dont see it and i dont know the hell im ever going to see it im on mg of zoloft now and i feel like a fucking zombie like a shell of who i was i rely so heavily on others to do my bidding for me because the second i try to think for myself and think about anything other than ruminating over nothing i feel this insane amount of anxiety and fear pills wont fix me and i know that and i know running from how i feel wont fix me either i feel so careless about myself and quite honestly i dont care if i fall asleep and never wake up i used to fear god and fear death but at this point ive been asking god to take me in my sleep every night it feels like i cant get out of my head no matter how hard i try nothing feels real and i feel like im out of control of my own life like something or someone is living it im addicted to making myself miserable and to change feels impossible at this point im just ranting because ive already tried talking to my parents and friends and it feels like nothing is helping me all i ever wan na do is sleep and pain doesnt even affect me anymore i find ive become extremely desensitized to every day life and live it in my head im almost at that point that i want to just end it all and give up what else is there out here for me does it even get better even if i dont care to make it get better,2,2

something im not i derive satisfaction from the way others people perceive me and that alone yet somehow the way i see myself overpowers what anyone tells me i always feel deep down that no matter who it is that they secretly think negative things of me i cant help but feeling empty it never improves never gets better it only gets worse every time someone tells me things that i want to hear yet im not ready for how many friendships how many things do i have to do wrong before the motivation to improve hits my ears how many times do i have to betray myself and corrupt my morals until i feel satisfied with the image in my mirror i cant stand to look at myself i tell myself im happy that im content and ive gotten pretty good at feining my mental state infront of people i smile yet its always a mask to pretend that im something im not i hate myself i truly cant say theres a single thing that i like about myself im stuck i keep coming back to my pond the second i catch a view of the ocean i enclose myself in my digital encounters in the comfort i can only find hidden behind a screen my parents were always right its my damn phone ive become so entranced in this person i want people to think i am that i fail to ever improve myself in any way i need help and im not sure what that means therapy fails to help me drugs fail to help me i only feel true comfort and safety behind the wall of a screen a moment in time where i dont have to be myself or i can confide in the fact that im not truly happy i keep betraying people to try and pull myself out of the pit of dissatisfaction im in even in moments where the consequences have no comparable worth to what ill lose i take it im drowning chained down by the subconscious image i make of myself i need a life raft even one that will sink shortly after i get stuck in moments whether i think it or not my minds always begging someone for help if i even get a hint of affection i lose my moral compass i look for a way to take that life raft so i can save myself the burden of losing myself to my emotions ive ruined far too many friendships with my mentality my mind its constantly stabbing me with these thoughts hoping someone notices enough to get me help to offer a hand to carry me out of this hole that i keep digging myself into im addicted to my mask writing this i can only think how disappointed i would be in myself as a kid i dont have many friends i push people away trying to chase after a solitary affection that can soothe my thoughts if even for a moment ive crammed myself into a box and locked myself away because im scared of being hurt worse i never got over my depression i never got over the feelings ive had i only learned how to fake my emotions until people would believe them i learned how to feel apathetic and pretend that its ok but the more i live like this the more i realize solitary moments of happiness are far from enough to break me free of the weights tied to my ankles i cant stand to look at myself anymore every momentary happiness ends up adding weight to this feeling every time im happy i get worse than before i get reminded of how shit my life is why do i have to feel like this i have amazing parents i may not have many friends but i have a few that are close yet i choose those momentary rafts of peace over the important things in my life ive gotten so used to this mask that i cant even cry over my losses even if i tried my hearts been shattered and i havent been able to find the courage to glue back the pieces i confide in where i feel safe every hint of someone not liking me somehow manages to break every ounce of this fake confidence ive built up for myself i just feel numb empty no matter who i lose i can always feign my happiness and pull myself up the ladder every rung i climb i leave behind a piece of my sanity i cant look at what ive made myself to be im a failure of a human being a douchebag friend a shadow of what i wanted to be years old yet i already want to give up on the rest of the time infront of me mia uriah caio mike matteo george jesus sebastian luna caitlyn dayne how many times do i have to fuck up everything with the people i love before i realize i need fucking help why do i only feel ok if im not in my own reality my memories only drag me down looking back at when everything was perfect just to remember how everything came crashing down how i lost everything i cant lose anymore im at the end of my string with a pair of scissors closing little by little every day im forcing myself through doors im not even remotely ready to go through im always anxious im always depressed im always stealing satisfaction from people i have everything i need to live a good life yet i cant manage to grasp a single thing to help anyone or myself i let every opportunity slip out of my fingers lay back and sleep trying not to think about living another day im unstable and i dont know what to do i cant help but feeling like a burden to everyone around me like a problem i want to be happy i want to build and keep relationships but how can i if all i can ever manage to do is push everything away im a loss away from breaking every time someone asks if im ok i have to sit back and lie through my teeth saying that im doing great im sorry to myself to everyone i cant take this shit much longer my mind is but a mirror and i cant stand looking at myself for another second its my fault and no one elses that i dug myself into this i just hope i can find a ladder before i put this shovel through my throat,6,1

want to post on here because my life isnt as bad as others most of my life has been with emotional and physical abuse when i was a kid my brothers dad my at the time stepdad i believe tried to drown me in the bathtub he would sometimes without warning grab my head and hold it at the bottom before releasing i remember waking up randomly throughout the day with a black eye seeing my mom get beat so hard into a closet her lung collapsed and him being arrested and her having to go to the hospital later she found a bf that used to take her phone from her forget to feed us and yell at us while she was at work i remember waiting for her to get home around pm and her wondering why we didnt eat or were out of bed later she found a good step dad for around years and we were genuinely happy i made some friends and progressed through school later they broke up and she found another boyfriend this guy was emotionally abusive calling us retarded dumbass or looking for an excuse to turn us against each other this was during high school i remember being so exhausted during the day that i slept my life away at school moving between classes just to fall asleep again i remember one day watching my brothers sisters and him get into a fight and he pinned my sister to the ground and slapped her in the face i remember just standing there not doing anything but hearing her scream and cry the cops ended up being called and he ran off they said it was just regular punishment and he came back later my mom was also being mentally abused as well at this point being told we were suffering because of her or she wasnt caring for us enough even though she was the only one working at the time to pay the bills my grades in high school dropped i isolated from friendships and somehow managed to graduate fortunately at this point most of my friends were gone or not on speaking terms ive tried going to see therapists and trying different medications we finally got rid of the last boyfriend and are in a way better spot with this new one that i consider a step dad most recently i lost my grandmother to ovarian cancer her and my grandpa and aunt are where i had some of my best memories now my biological dad is going around telling his parents that im not his son mom says i was dna tested in the hospital while he was in federal jail for smuggling drugs into a military base and selling them my mom has always had low self worth as well and she looks at the way her decisions have affected us and is struggling with depressions mow too and comes to me since were kinda close in age year difference i love my mom but it just adds on to my stress but cant bring myself to tell her that im now jobless no license no goals no ambitions ive been recently thinking about suicide alot lately more than alot lately ive cut myself before more out instinct from self hatred but the release i got was kind of addicting now ive thought about it enough to where i have a couple ideas that i could do i try to imagine how others or strangers would react if died in front of them ive imagined me taking my life dying trying to save someone or even just dying from natural causes out of nowhere for some reason whenever i think about it i smile not out of crazy but it comforts me i used to think about it when i worked at amazon a lot as well before i quit because my mental health was getting worse i eventually became bed ridden due to anxiety heart would race and i would get dizzy just getting out of bed now i feel even more of a burden just sitting playing games using up food money and electricity sleeping all day and providing nothing back i feel more recently like taking my life because the world didnt want me my mom i know loves and worries about me when i was younger i made secret to never kill myself till she was gone and now i kind of regret it not that i dont love her but i feel like thats all im living for anymore i wish i had stuff like friends or a girlfriend even though i cant afford these kinds of things it feels like it would give me a purpose outside of just really close family this is my first time doing anything like this and wanted to just let it all out

know deep want hero moments im agent superpowers middle car chase desperately trying protect someoneonly someone always someone ive imagined moment never thought normal still dont feels weird sometimes feels like im living world removed one around almost like im acting roles head fantasies feel real thats hardest part explain therapist without sounding completely utterly crazy honestly feels crazy want feel present im wrapped daydreams like cant terrifying sometimes feel like reality slipping feel disconnected everything happening around wish could moment without distractions without questioning every thought feeling hard especially im trying make sense,is this real will the daydreams stop there are times when i wonder if im really struggling with my mental health at all its like im caught in this endless loop of questioning myself my feelings and my reality on one hand i feel like i cant get anything right my emotions dont match how i think im supposed to feel and im constantly secondguessing whether what im experiencing is real most of the time i feel numblike i dont care about anything and its hard to find meaning in anything i do but then there are moments where i feel a spark like a desire to be happy to actually experience joy but once that feeling starts i find myself pulling back questioning if its real is this happiness or am i just pretending am i really capable of feeling this way or is it all just a facade and the worst part is i start to wonder if ive been faking it the whole time if ive been using my mental health struggles as some sort of attentionseeking act when in reality maybe ive always been okay maybe ive just been convincing myselfand everyone elsethat im struggling when in truth im fine this thought spirals into a deep sense of shame like im somehow doing something wrong or dishonest when all i really want is to feel understood its such a confusing cyclesometimes i feel like im truly struggling and other times i question everything wondering if im just pretending it feels like i cant trust myself like im always at odds with my own mind and honestly its exhausting but i know i have to keep reminding myself that its okay to not have all the answers to not feel completely certain mental health is messy and sometimes even the act of questioning itself is part of the process and then theres the daydreaming sometimes my mind takes me to places where im someone completely differentsomeone strong and skilled someone whos capable of incredible things i imagine myself as a weapons specialist a car or motorcycle expert or a computer genius in these daydreams im always the one in control the one with the power and the knowledge to fix things ive always been some type of specialist always the strongest in my mind but then there are other times when im not the one in control im the damsel in distress the person caught in some kind of prophecy or maybe the villain whos forced into that role by a powerful parent even though i know deep down i want to be the hero and then there are moments when im an agent with superpowers in the middle of a car chase desperately trying to protect someoneonly that someone is always just someone ive imagined in that moment i never thought this was normal i still dont it feels weird sometimes it feels like im living in my own world removed from the one around me its almost like im acting out these roles in my head these fantasies that feel so real and thats the hardest part how do i explain this to my therapist without sounding completely utterly crazy because honestly it feels crazy i want to feel present but when im so wrapped up in these daydreams its like i cant its terrifying sometimes to feel like my reality is slipping to feel disconnected from everything happening around me i wish i could just be here in the moment without all of these distractions without questioning my every thought and feeling but its hard especially when im trying to make sense of it

work and give up on studying ive thought about doing an mba my job would sponsor part of it but i havent studied seriously since my college days during covid and im not sure i can handle it weekends are my only escape and i dont want to lose them one day while doomscrolling instagram i stumbled across adhd memes i liked them and social media kept showing me more which oddly made me feel relaxedlike im not the only one who feels this scattered i even apologized to a friend i once yelled at for not improving his behavior hes clinically diagnosed with adhd after realizing how hard it can be for some people to change now im reading books like cbt for adhd to build healthier habits i know i should see a counselor to get diagnosed but i had awful experiences last timeone guy was a fearmongering scam artistand im not ready to try again for now im just reading not taking meds or anything i also recently noticed i was forgetting to breathe properly which was spiking my stress and wrecking my sleep ive been working on it and even managed to meditate twice which felt like a win i live with my parents and my younger brother hes in college studying engineering like me my dad runs a small hardware business but he doesnt want me to join since its not doing well i love spending time with my family my girlfriend who i plan to marry though shes also jobhunting and stressed and old school friendsits what keeps me sane but im bad at making new friends and feel less ambitious than my college peers like im fading into nothingness my girlfriend and i want to start an instagram or youtube account as content creatorsim into writing stories cooking photography and making things prettybut i dont have the energy to start ive tried counselors before but they were bad experiences and too expensive so im hesitant to try again lately i get overwhelmed by career choices and my lack of passion i just want a job with good pay worklife balance and to stay near my family in north india but im scared ill lose what i have to ai or burnout my brothers working hard to get a job and i feel pressure to keep up but im exhausted i treat my family to little food outings sometimes and it

staying pool small sense community early wasnt much time progressed got meet locals bit along kids around age talked us coming skate park said extra skateboards kind shook never skateboarded day came said usually us im youre good youre cool kid people knew etc used almost felt worried go shame experienced kid invited sad luckily got see later last day family bit fuss whether stay sunset man met knew bit saw came invite match cornhole first step great night met kids introduced played matches found pretty good thats unrelated later night experienced something really hadnt went beach saw kids building huge sand fort thingy shovel bit timid first saying much observing followed tentatively got metal detector started looking around beach night went got comfortable even trying speak much english possible could understand running around making jokes asking sports played etc ended best night vacation regrettably last hadnt really experienced something like grew fancy large separated new england suburbs never chance ever play neighbors kids everyone separated big trees bushy gardens didnt grow around traditional suburbs everyone knew everyone went school since also go private school minutes away didnt lot chances make local friends could walk experience made really hooked community getting house talked parents also said community would great aspect add life unfortunately live dads demanding job moms perimenopause otherthankfully bay health concerns getting house tough feel like experience blessingcurse made realize maybe community life would great also like friends ripped away knowing itll super tough something like current situation complex ive noticed ive pretty sad ive cried twice rare hope someone see kind taking toll please tell go isnt mental health wan na feel validated get help,im going through some weird feelings right now im and i come from a wealthy familythis will make sense contextually i just returned from a vacation from costa rica originally we stayed to more traditional vacation activities with some surf lessons and staying by our pool there was a small sense of community early on but it wasnt that much as time progressed i got to meet the locals a bit along with some kids who were around my age they talked about us coming over to a skate park and said they had extra skateboards i kind of shook it off because i have never skateboarded before the day came and i said no usually in the us where im from its all about if youre good or not if youre a cool kid if people knew you etc i was so used to this that i almost felt worried to go because of that shame i had experienced the kid who invited me was sad but luckily i got to see them later on the last day my family and i had a bit of a fuss about whether we should stay for sunset or not a man who i had met and knew a bit saw this and came over to me to invite me to a match of cornhole this was the first step in that great night i met the kids there and introduced myself further and played a few matches with them in which i found i was pretty good but thats unrelated later on that night i experienced something i really hadnt before we went down to the beach and i saw the kids building some huge sand fort thingy with a shovel i was a bit timid at first not saying much and just observing but i followed them tentatively as they got a metal detector and started looking around the beach as the night went on i got more comfortable with them even trying to speak as much english as possible so i could understand them all we were running around making jokes asking each other about what sports we played etc it ended up being the best night of vacation and regrettably the last i hadnt really experienced something like this before as i grew up in fancy large separated new england suburbs i never had a chance to ever play with the neighbors kids as everyone was separated by big trees and bushy gardens i didnt grow up around traditional suburbs where everyone knew everyone and we all went to the same school and such since i also go to a private school minutes away so i didnt have a lot of chances to make more local friends that i could walk over to the experience made me really hooked on community and getting out of the house and such i talked with my parents and they also said that community would be a great aspect to add to their life unfortunately because of where we live my dads demanding job and my moms perimenopause and otherthankfully at bay health concerns getting out of the house is tough i feel like the experience was a blessingcurse it made me realize that maybe having community in my life would be great but it also was like these friends being ripped away from me and knowing that itll be super tough to have something like that with my current situation this is complex for me and ive noticed ive been pretty sad after it ive cried twice over it which is rare for me i hope someone can see me here because this is kind of taking a toll on me please tell me where to go if this isnt mental health i just wan na feel validated and get some help,1,0

the past years ive had this mentality that life has no meaning since we all die anyway i always tell my friends that whats the point of wealth fame or status if you cant take it with you to the grave but back then i still enjoyed life playing games listening to music designing because somewhere clinging to hope in i graduated and planned to move to canada for school thinking maybe things would change if i was on my own i moved in late lived in a bnb for two weeks and then got introduced to some people through a family friend i ended up living with five other guys all older than me all working while i was the only one studying we had no common interests except basketball which i developed we played a few times a year other than that i never socialize with them i go to school and then sit in my room at some point i started feeling empty to everyone else it looked like i was enjoying life going to school playing games but inside i was just distracting myself from the thought that nothing really matters i lost interest in everything i used to love and felt like i was living for nothing no purpose no meaning i graduated in april last year completely lost i had spent so much of my parents money moving abroad but it felt worthless since i didnt even enjoy the thing i studied i got my work permit in september and lied to my parents about searching for job when in reality i had no clue what i was doing i was just lost and rotting in my bed all day and then as time moved on my parents kept asking me about whats happening with job search i started searching even though i had no idea of what im searching for i just applied for roles that i can put a bare minimum effort then in january my lease ended and everyone moved out a friend offered me a room at his place until i found a job so i moved in we talk about life a lot but it always turns into an argument he believes money and work are everything because thats what people care about i say none of it matters unless youre actually happy to be fair ive never cared about moneymaterialistic things i joke about killing myself a lot and he knows i dont go out dont talk to people dont take care of myself and barely eat my parents dont know about it since i always say its im alright but a few days ago my friend somehow found my dads facebook and told him everything the suicidal jokes but about me not eating or going out that led to a hour conversation with my parents my mom told me to come back home saying a job doesnt matter my dad guilt tripped me even though he claims he doesnt care about the money he spent on me when i asked my friend why he did that he said it was for my sake but it just frustrated me more what am i supposed to do when i cant even figure out why im alive since that talk with my dad i keep wondering if i even want to be here anymore i regret oversharing with my friend because now everything feels worse is there even point of me being alive when i have no purposemeaning and just wasting

supporting,navigating covidsupport last updated july its been nearly threeandahalf years since this sub was recreated on feb with the intention of it being a place where people could come for advice and reassurance about the then not quite officially but clearly heading in that direction covid pandemic an alternative to sensational media stories and difficulttointerpretunlessyoureanexpert scientific papers it sprang out of a recognition that on other covid subs people were asking questions they wanted answered but that those subs did not want to set themselves up to answer a space was needed where selfposts were welcomed and responded to a lot has changed since then mostly and this is extremely important for how this sub operates covid has come has been conquered by vaccination by evolution of less serious strains by herd immunity that going forward will be embedded in childhood and has largely gone its over and were out the other side for the vast vast majority of people life today doesnt and doesnt need to look significantly different to how it did in and if it does for you because you have serious underlying health conditions or because you dont want things to go back to normal this is not the place for you if you fall into the former category you need qualified medical professionals advice on how to navigate the residual risks of the pandemic and if youre in the latter category you need qualified medical professionals advice on how to get past this noone here is qualified to give you either this is the place for you if you want it to go back to normal but are struggling to get there users here are great for explaining how they have coped and offering suggestions or helping you to realise that even if youve had a really tought three years it wont always be like this if you have family members who are significantly more or less cautious than you and want help and suggesions with how to deal with them which may be that theyre right and youre less right and you would may be best giving them some leeway and if as was initially intended you need help understanding something in the media or a scientific journal thats not entirely clear that last one is pretty much the only one i wanted to be answering when i started this sub but the rest of you had other ideas i rolled with it mostly but i drew the line at things i didnt think were helpful such as validating extreme behaviours i will continue to do so the sub is much quieter these days than it used to be which is absolutely the way it should be people largely no longer need advice about to deal with the pandemic because its pretty much over were out the other side for those of you who do still find your way here please take note of whats written above this isnt the place for people who dont want to ever go into a crowded bar again or think air travel is death sentence or arent ever going to send their kids to inperson school there are places on reddit to connect with people who think like that personally i think theyre as dangerous as the subs that in mid were calling for no restrictions at all and which tell you vaccination will cause cancer and kill you but unlike those sub theyre not a danger to society so if thats where you want to be its ultimately up to you please go there but please leave my sub alone throughout the pandemic we have walked hopefully successfully a fine line between making reasonable adjustments to behaviour where theyre justified and calling them out where theyre not eg in april keep your distance in a supermarket or the street but dont bleach your groceries in april enjoy your graduation ceremonycousins weddingtaylor swift concert times change holding the middle ground hasnt always made us popular with lockdown skeptics or those who dont

socks basically hate going hospital hate much im really happy havent go yet month also want things get prepandemic life back already unrealistic highrisk person know people wont mask feel like try harder normal comfortable around people could give covid pandemic right know likely covid mild cold since im young vaccinated even mild cold generally means several weeks nebulizer dries skin like crazy plus also tastes really nasty imagine squirting wet playdough mouth four times day,tired of being high risk just want to take risks unlike a lot of twentysomethings on this sub i guess im pretty high risk i have severe asthma plus a heart condition plus digestive system issues im a genetic mutant but not like the xmen my medical team has given me paxlovid so i can start it immediately in case i develop any symptoms ended up taking it during a sinus infection last month not fun tbh they also gave me a pulse oximeter and told me to call if its ever below its been weird how every time i notify them that ive been exposed they call or email me back right away i did get covid in but my asthma has gotten significantly worse since then to the point where im now on multiple additional medications for it and i was hospitalized during my first infection for strokelike symptoms very surreal showing up to the er and then realizing i couldnt talk or move the right half of my body ive never seen doctors in such a hurry the thing is im miserable sure ive been told my mental health is great for someone with such serious health issues but im still unhappy i know my genetic condition is degenerative i want to travel and see friends and have adventures before i end up in a wheelchair or on a feeding tube i want to go to parties and have my silly little drinks in silly little overpriced cafes while i can still swallow them especially because my genetic condition is rare enough that there isnt a lot of info on my longterm prognosis i could live till or have my spine collapse next week no one really knows i was offered a free trip to a convention in a city ive always dreamed about visiting by a relative with a lot of airline miles i want to do it even though i know no one will be masked but i also want to stay out of the hospital hospitals are noisy crowded and have bad wifi and gross food im not scared of death ive gotten close enough to it enough times to make my peace with it i just dont want to be stuck listening to heart monitors beeping nonstop being woken up at all hours of the night to get poked with needles listening to people screaming in pain cold ultrasound gel and uncomfortable eeg leads that are hard to pull off cold scratchy blankets or shitting in a bedpan because my legs dont work again and dont even get me started when it comes to nonslip socks basically i hate going to the hospital i hate it so much and im really happy i havent had to go yet this month but i also want to do things and get my prepandemic life back already am i being unrealistic as a highrisk person i know people wont mask for me and i feel like i should try harder to be normal and be more comfortable around people who could give me covid after all the pandemic is over right i know its likely that covid will just be a mild cold for me since im young and vaccinated but even a mild cold generally means several weeks on a nebulizer for me and that dries out my skin like crazy plus it also tastes really nasty imagine squirting wet playdough into your mouth four times a day,18,10

not aware of anywhere else giving support about covidrelated support i guess im looking to vent and for reassurance support or advice of some kind this is gon na be a long one sorry basically the title i miss my old life before the pandemic and i continue to struggle with the fact that things have changed my mental health has been completely destroyed by this stage of the pandemic where the world continues on as if longterm disability isnt on the table from a covid infection this world where there is little horizon for the pandemic to get better in terms of comfortably avoiding infection without nasal vaccines and what not has just completely drawn all the wind out of my will to continue i just cant imagine a future where my life is better coupled with the fact that life is simply passing by in my years of youth which it feels like covid stole from me for context ive been taking covid precautions seriously since the very beginning and have continued to mask always indoors kn or better avoided any large gatherings even paid attention to the wind direction outside to try and sit upwind of people etc for me its always been about avoiding long covid at all costs and protecting my parents who are at risk there was that brief moment postvax in where things were different and i was able to let loose of course if you were living in the global north that is and not getting fucked over in the global south by ip laws to the benefit of vaccine manufacturers and the vaccines were effective at preventing infection but then delta and omicron took off and recharged the landscape of precautions so it was back to my safe measuresoutdoors only rules until the ability to avoid infection via nasal vaccinenasal spraywhatever the fuck would be feasible again but i truly dont know how long i can keep doing this and yet i know have to protect myself from potential future harm im still holding out for the nasal vaccine to resume indoor activities and all life feels empty without all the things i had in and ive been extremely depressed since then which has stunted my ability to be productive and pursue my goals i just cant get over this dilemma ive been in therapy and sometimes it makes things better for a moment but i just cant get my brain to happily accept that an empty life is the indefinite future whats the point of doing anything at all as a result of the precautions ive taken which have also kept me and my family safe no doubt i feel so alone and depressed my academic advancement has been stunted i can barely focus on reading and writing anymore despite intermittent sudden bursts of passion every once in awhile ive missed academic opportunities because ive been too depressed to actually do anything about them ive hemorrhaged friends and even relationships with family members have become strained because they think i dont want to see them anymore or that i dont put enough effort when in reality all they ever want to do is shit that involves being indoorsunmaskedunsafe and all of this essentially alone because no one i know outside of my close family cares about actually not getting infected anymore even my close family is starting to get frustrated with them and with them im trying to help them stay the course but in private im not doing too hot mentally to make things worse the fighting in my household has gotten way worse since the pandemic its unrelated topically in the constant arguments and toxicity that gets flung around but obviously adds tension to the context this toxicity has affected my ability to work at home in the past i was able to essentially deal with this via escapism going out etc however bc of my precautions i still take i dont have the strategies and ways to cope that i used to i have close friends who generally are open to doing whats comfortable for me at a given time which has been a huge blessing but as soon as i get home after hanging with them i just return to my depressed baseline setting aside my social life dating has also essentially been nonexistent for me since the start of the pandemic too because of the obvious obstacles wearing a mask isnt exactly the easiest way to get to know someone but the sexual frustration is fucking insane im only human i had brief fwb thing for a couple months in but things became more difficult as the ba kicked in and she also had to move for school right now im on the apps but ive realized this is basically pointless since no one ive run into is covidcautious so that bottles the chance for that life feels empty without all the things i had in and ive been extremely depressed since then which has stunted my ability to be productive and pursue my goals i feel like a completely different person ive effectively been mourning the years such that i feel robbed of my college yearss at this point im at a point where it gives me pain to see other people living the life that i had it makes me resentful of people younger than me who got to have those experiences even though i feel guilty about that resentment im struck with painful nostalgia constantly longing for days that are gone i was in my rd year of undergrad when the pandemic struck im now in my nd year of grad school opening instagram at all immediately sends me into dire straits mentally seeing all the people not only not giving a fuck at all about covid but also living the life that i miss so dearly i miss parties i miss going to bars i miss not having to think of different possible scenarios re covid that may hinder my ability to have fun at a given thing that i get invited to i miss being a fun person i miss the mystery of what a night may hold when hanging out with a friend going out meeting new people dating experiencing new shit all the shit that one associates with their s its gone before there was mystery to what the day or the night might hold when i think of my life before the pandemic i think of the excitement and it honestly all feels like a happy dream that i woke up from of course rosetinted glasses caveats that this is probably not how it was and that im in a certainly privileged position etc etc i just dont know what to do anymore i feel like all i can do is sit around and watch movies bc im so fucking depressed i dont make the money to live on my own all the potential roommate candidates that would join me in getting long flouted protections the prospect of a nasal vaccine though happy recent signs have been shown doesnt seem to be on the horizon for a while i have no reward system anymore to motivate me to do my work i suppose im looking for advice or support or something by posting this xb how do you guys cope currently xb tldr things are fucked i want to figure how to be get unfucked,19,28

support actions possibly kept able spend time dying mother mother passed away nps advice working relieves anxiety told trying get ssi hard later got ssi,been dealing with numerous neurological and physical symptoms since late that i suspect may have been caused by a bad case of covid looking for any advice or support the neuropathy ive had really scares me as its the only thing not going away in june i quit my mg dosage of lexapro that i had taken since cold turkey due to a few things i was constantly anxious and ocd and lexapro wasnt helping at all i probably had built up a very strong tolerance to it my aprn prescriber not my primary care doctor or a psychiatrist was a hassle to deal with and not a very nice person she was a good person to deal with at first but later on became less interested in me and seemed indifferent to my declining mental state she also upped my dosage of lexapro to mg over time for reasons i can not remember in just before the cold turkey i had suggested to her that i possibly switch to another medication as i thought lexapro wasnt working anymore and she refused to change me to something else the aprn moved to texas in she never suggested seeing somebody locally after they moved they are not licensed to practice in texas only ri ct or and wa texas law says they need to work with a physician to practice psych med management but they are not licensed in texas they only live there so im not sure legally what they are required to do i live in rhode island and i could only get a refill through telehealth webcam visits and my webcam didnt work for the session in june meaning they refused to give me a refill and didnt suggest other ways to get one i started taking over the counter htp as a replacement for the lexapro but it had no effect either nothing was helping my anxiety at all last year it came to a head in late september after being at the er for an intense panic attack that spanned days until i was able to cool down at the er a mental health social worker had been to my house during the breakdown but referred me to a mental health facility that wasnt taking any new patients rendering that service useless in a time when i was having an intense breakdown of emotions the last time this had happened was in which led to my ocdanxiety diagnosis i recontacted the aprn as they were a person who knew my case as i had seen them for years by then and were able to see me very soon after this breakdown and she put back on lexapro but at a mg dosage this time instead of mg they didnt seem concerned about me quitting mg cold turkey the fact that i had quit in general so harshly the fact that emtspolice had been to the house because of my breakdown no real concern she also did not want me to run any health tests before putting me back on medication nor did she ask if i was taking any supplements or other medications such as the htp i had previously taken when if combined with an ssri can cause serotonin syndrome which can be fatal about to weeks into this reinstatement i remember feeling a very heavy dull numblike feeling in my head that built up over a few days mainly at the top of my head but it felt like it was inside my brain too i began having jaw stiffness during the day not really bruxism because it wasnt clenching my jaw would just jut out unconsciously and then i started getting acute and severe health symptoms one on top of another i had to stop taking lexapro again due to these problems as i thought at the time the reinstatement was causing this the symptoms i can recall having occur suddenly from mid october to now are brain fog i have periods of derealization and just a general incorrect mental feeling memory loss both shortterm and longterm old memories are gonefuzzy hard to remember words daytoday memory is spotty hard to remember things done during the same day sometimes sinus inflammation throbbing headaches muscle twitching used to be very intense mainly in my legs and stomach bad cough dry mouth only in times when i was anxious though extremely dry throbbing lips not sure if anxiety caused this but for about days my lips were in intense pain while that happened extreme fatigue watery mucus dry sinuses nerve and muscle problems mainly in the left side of my face neck chest genitals and seldom in my left foot in the sole area my neck feels painful and stiff a lot on the left side i would get quick almost zaplike chest pains on both sides of my chest a few months ago but now its only on the left side my face on the left side will sometimes feel tingly burning or weak or numb my genitals only hurt in the left testicle and on the left side of my penis when i move it a certain way the right side of my leg feels weak at times too my left foot would have a burning feeling sometimes an intense bout of facial warmness one day my entire face felt like it was on fire i had an ice pack on it all night ear ringing either side multiple times a day nausea pale lips an iron deficiency numb emotions and numb libido breathing problems sometimes i have to manually breathe instead of automatically and my breathing can get labored and shallow blood in my mucusphlegm body painburning in my upper body about to minutes after waking up eventually goes away after i get out of bed some of these symptoms have improved and some havent everything save for neuropathy memory and blunted emotions is pretty much gone the neuropathy used to manifest as burning and tingling and now is reduced sensitivity it only affects the left side of my body even in my genital area the left side of my genitals are not affected the neuropathy now manifests as reduced sensitivity and sometimes stinging pains in my genitals the aprn refused to have me as a client after these symptoms occurred even though they were more than happy to take me on as a client after i had quit cold turkey and had a breakdown they now made the stipulation that i needed to see a therapist before i would be able to see this aprn again and this was something they had never required beforehand my mother was sick with terminal cancer at the same time as this and this person was of no emotional support instead one time getting upset with me for waking them up by calling them even though it was the only number they use for their practice and saying insulting things like i should have gone to therapy long before this even though in the years i had seen them they had never required it even after i saw a therapist their excuse became we both decided you should see somebody locally for med management something they had never said beforehand and was something they never suggested after they left to move to texas this aprn had never required me in the years i had seen them to regularly see a pcp or a therapist only after these problems happened did they require me to see a therapist they never mentioned seeing a pcp its strange as this person advertises her practice as being both therapy and medication management also how would the aprn know if i wasnt seeing a therapist she worked independently many states away it seems like a fake excuse to get rid of me as she may have thought she caused my health problems she also never referred me to anybody themselves leaving me to do that im guessing they got scared that they possibly caused these problems and wanted to dump me as soon as possible making me feel like i was in the wrong over two years later i am still not really sure what caused this some have suggested it is long covid some have said that the lexapro reinstatement might have caused a kindling effect in my brainnervous system since i had gone off mg cold turkey and some suggest its intense stress maybe it was serotonin syndrome due to the htp usage just before going back on lexapro i dont know all that i do know is about to weeks into lexapro reinstatement i got very sick it began with a mushy weird numb feeling in my head not a headache and then i started getting a ton of weird vascularneurologicalnerve related problems as well as sinus inflammation i feel my symptoms are way too severe to be caused by anything related to lexapro as this is a medication i took since i was years old and had cold turkeyd previously more than once with the worst thing happening being worse mood most likely due to the harsh withdrawal for instance i believe in i stopped taking it for about a month or two noticed getting very depressed and went back on in i also quit it again but went back on a few months later with the worst feeling being feeling spaced out but not sick i never had any physical or neurological symptoms going back on it i have been left emotionally traumatized by this treatment i was diagnosed with severe depression by a psychologist i am still seeing doctors to find out my mystery chronic illness i do not know if legally this np is liable but in my view she acted in a way that should warrant it she was reckless and cruel at a time when i needed emotional support the most her actions possibly kept me from being able to spend time with my dying mother after my mother passed away the nps advice for me was working relieves anxiety and when i told her i was trying to get ssi that its very hard to do i later got ssi,28,58

day realistically not even hours i wear my mask i take my nasal spray thats meant to help with covid and flus theres these covid gums you can get that apparently helps not contract it or something idk look im desperate when i come home i turn on our hepa filter and i gurgle mouthwash again ive no idea if its true that i helps but im really not taking any chances then for a week ill test myself and record any symptoms thats the plan its a lot more than what other people do i do the spray mask and hepa thing almost daily when im heading to the shops but my dad hes not impressed i told him this today and he just said yeah but youre still going out shopping im not going to and i just exploded his son still goes to school without a mask thats fine he lets his unvaccinated sister into the same room as him thats fine he goes to a funeral without a mask on thats fine but i want to meet people which i havent done in the last years because of this with as much precaution i can take and apparently theres a problem i dont want covid but i dont want to be trapped in my house all the time ive lost friends over this ive gone from being socially confident with friends and doing radio interviews it was for a school project to not being able to even say one word to strangers without having a panic attack im trying i really am im trying to get on with my life without putting my dad in danger i feel as if ive gone above and beyond to keep him safe and he doesnt see it i literally isolated myself from school because of delta i became known as someone who was superstitious about covid and people would cough in front of me deliberately in classrooms i got into fights with my teachers and classmates over this whole thing i defended my dad countless times and honestly im not the most healthiest of persons either i could be at risk for covid cause of my countless medical problems and i cried myself to sleep a lot of nights about the possibility of my dad getting covid im autistic and i hate wearing the masks but i do it for him im trying my best here i had to cancel birthdays days out a lot of things to keep him safe ive gotten all my vaccines and flu shots ive done everything i can and apparently its still not enough i am done i cant do this anymore i really cant i really do feel trapped and stuck in time again i dont want to contract this disease i really dont its taken to many people its even taken my uncle for fucks sake it could even take me out but i also need to live a life as safely as i can he acts as if im going to go off the rails with no masks and no precautions during winter which isnt the case at all itll only be one small gathering for less than hours and maybe wont even bother sorry if im rambling and repeating myself and spelling things wrong its another one of my am rants please dont take this as me not caring about covid i do i really do its taken so much away from me im trying to balance my life with my dads safety and its so hard cause i feel bad for even stepping outside the door,8,3

past years conceive part story life understand continue story many things valued aspired feel impossible would grateful advice guidance people care offer even absent grateful time attention thank,how to pick up the pieces hello and thank you for reading i want to start by saying that i remain an advocate for fastidious covid safety precautions and do not intend now or ever to harm myself in any way i further implore any readers who are going through difficulties in their life to likewise not harm themselves in any way i am not in a place where i am well equipped to offer support right now but i hope you find better times soon the trouble i had with covid was different than what a lot of people had nobody i knew lost their life or suffered serious lingering health problems at this time i have either never had covid or had only an extremely mild case i hope not to impune the tragedy of anybody who was not so fortunate but all the same the distress it has caused me has been immense i have been among the most obsessively fastidious person out of everyone i knew when it has come to covid safety i still am but ive been working in therapy towards maintaining caution while having a healthier attitude that has included highly responsible people and others less so ive had close calls or perceived close calls ive had to share living space with people who didnt share my standards of personal pandemic safety which was immensely stressful and i have been gravely worried about being responsible for harming someone else leading to even more obsessive precautions this far more than concern about risk to myself has been the reason for my extreme caution part of the cause for this extreme distress was due to preexisting mental health issues ive had a possibly mild form of aspergers syndrome for my entire life and learning how to manage it had been difficult i had never been socially outgoing in college and while i did make more and better friends than i had ever had before i was still a person who clung strongly to my personal comfort zone then after college partly due to the fact that i found job applications to be extremely emotionally taxing and partly due to prevailing postgreatrecession conditions i ended up with a customer service job that i was overqualified for and which was very stressful because it involved getting yelled at by distressed strangers i dont blame them personally but it was a very uncomfortable daily life i finally dug myself out of that situation by qualifying for graduate school i finished graduate school about two years later at the age of and finally got a job that paid well enough to let me be independent just before i turned i still had the same strong group of friends i had back in college but i hadnt really broadened my personal horizons as much as i had wanted to i had moved a long distance for graduate school and attended a few events here and there but working as a teacher for the university while also studying was extremely demanding and i was almost always too tired to push myself further out of my shell once i had my new job i was more optimistic about my future than i had ever been before i had managed to change my life for the better i was almost an independent adult and i still had three more years to live that young adult life that our culture raises up as such an ideal move to the big city see sights have experiences and meet new people i wanted to pursue a romantic relationship for the first time i had never had the chance to do so before due to my anxiety and priorities making it difficult to give seeking someone out the work it would require for me when left to follow my instincts i would rarely put myself in a situation where i could meet new people i dont blame the world i dont blame society i knew i would have to put work and focus on it or it would never happen but at that point in my life i believed i was capable of it and then covid happened a few months after i started my new job and i was scared scared for myself scared for the people close to me but mostly scared that i would fail to measure up as a human being and end up just causing problems the next two years would be one emotional ordeal after another firstly there was the pandemic novelty and general despair of there were the times that people close to me got infected there were the episodes of tortuous guilt over potential lapses in my own caution when i should have known better there was the continuous dashing of false hope as new variants emerged faded and emerged again rendering the original vaccines of increasingly questionable value in late i started receiving professional help it has been helpful pretty much all of for me has been a long and arduous rehabilitation process coupled with a painful search for a place to live amidst a predatory market its been effective i no longer jump in fear and guilt when a dog runs towards me between all the hard times there were still moments when i had fun with my friends online i managed to raise my standing at my job im still not an independent adult quite yet since i havent found a place to live on my own ive still never had a relationship both because of the imposed isolation of the pandemic and mostly because i didnt have the emotional capacity for that kind of vulnerability when conditions were so harsh and now ive just turned years old i feel like i wasted what could have been the most precious years of my life my last chance to be a young person my own person to not just be one of those quiet kids always staring at their own feet to try and be the center of attention to make up for all the lost time i was supposed to have spent exploring but now its gone now im an old person trying to explore now would feel crass and delusional at best i feel like being makes me inherently unendearing being in your s gives people an excuse to like you and ive traditionally felt that i needed any such excuse i can get being in your s puts you at the center stage of culture now that book is closed for me and thanks to covid and the time it took me to learn how to control my own mind its mostly blank i feel like theres a gaping hole in my life when covid started i didnt have a strong foundation to value the life i was living what i had was momentum now the momentum is gone thanks to covid i basically just spent the past three years either suffering intensely or relearning how to do basic tasks like taking out the trash without freaking out not only did i never get to live like a mentally free young person but now i feel like im being asked to build the fifth story of a building in mid air with nothing below it i may have a job and some friends but i have no independent living space and no relationship history to build up the skills that any future prospects would expect me to have opportunities were missed and not built on happy memories that should exist were never formed i feel like ive lost my entire identity because for the past three years covid caution was the basis of my entire life its not like i actively pursued anything else so here i am at the end of my mental covid journey tired and feeling like i have very little to show for it with the shock wearing off i feel like i need to come to terms at last with things i thought i would be able to be or do even a year or a few months ago and now fear i never can i know that in a lot of ways ive been very privileged but for the past three years every single grain of effort i could muster up has been put towards fighting against my two worst enemies covid and myself and now that i am working to find a way to live a life with things being as they are i look back at three years that i had so much hope for which lived up to none of my hopes and i worry that the hope in question will be impossible to replace and even though in theory everybody went through some hard times during covid i feel like nobody talks about it and everybody is culturally obliged to laugh it off like it was just some minor annoyance when it wasnt i feel like i dont know how to process the past few years conceive of them as a part of the story of my life or understand how to continue that story now that so many things i once valued and aspired to now feel impossible i would be grateful for any advice or guidance that people care to offer even absent that i am grateful for your time and attention thank you,18,10

vacuuming used cats boyfriend tired pissing everything trying make food stove realize theres giant pile piss everyday much theres people family could use help im burnt work hour night shifts local hospital find constantly irritable lashing boyfriend desire sex anymore never good time theres never time feel relaxed enough decent amount helping sometimes ask multiple times annoying remember hes school works whatever days never full day understands im overwhelmed sometimes hard hes really quiet guy doesnt communicate much would like feel guilty im always angry want say fuck brain doesnt let constantly running try exercise self care try relieve stress time im exhausted everything else know get place well also practically slaves house really dont think bad always says house doesnt matter im tired looking shit outlets dont work house much shit needs fixed shes broke spends money things owes well bucks expenses ill probably never get back half windows house glass broken doesnt even pay house year old father also stressed shouldnt dealing things age anyway many details could probably type hours hopefully sums copelive next years miserable angry time,how do you cope with a temporary living situation hi looking for advice on coping with a temporary living situation ive been with my boyfriend for years this upcoming august have been living with him at his mothers house for probably the last years now that im im having a hard time not having our own place im good with saving my money i have grand saved at this point my boyfriend is finally going to be graduating in december of this year with a bachelor degree in biology im not worried that he wont find a good job quickly currently he works at target so i dont blame him for not able to save at this point as everything is so expensive and he pays for what he can this is why we think finding an apartment is stupid because we practically live rent free besides carhealth insurance and other small expenses what i need is help coping with living with his mom for the next couple years while we save a bit more money i love her like family she has always treated me like a daughter the last year she had relapsed with heroin and ever since the stress of everything has been so unbearable talking to a therapist for me hasnt really been doing much she is clean now but doesnt really do much around the house and i spent a whole months picking up the slack that ive built resentment and have stopped doing most things for her probably was a little bit of enablement the thing that i deal with is the mess drives me insane im a very clean person and seeing her giant piles of laundry sitting for weeks dishes piled up trash always overflowing when i finally get ready to do my own laundry i have to dry the wet pile of clothes she left in the dryer along with taking the wet clothes out of the wash that she left and drying those before i can even start my own the cats that we have that she doesnt take care of finally i give in and do the litter because im tired of breathing that in the constant vacuuming we used the have cats but my boyfriend and i were tired of them pissing on everything we own and trying to make food on the stove when you realize theres a giant pile of piss everyday was too much theres other people in our family that could use help but im just too burnt out i work hour night shifts at the local hospital i find myself constantly irritable and lashing out at my boyfriend i have no desire to have sex anymore because its never a good time and theres never a time that i feel relaxed enough to do so he does do a decent amount with helping sometimes i have to ask him multiple times which can be annoying but i do remember that hes in school and works whatever days he can he never has a full day off he understands that im overwhelmed but sometimes it hard as hes a really quiet guy and doesnt communicate as much as i would like i just feel guilty that im always angry and i just want to say fuck it all but my brain doesnt let me its just constantly running i try to exercise and self care to try and relieve my stress but most of the time im too exhausted from doing everything else i know that when we get our own place well also practically be slaves to the house but i really dont think it will be this bad she always says this is her house it doesnt matter what she does but im so tired of looking at all the shit of the outlets dont work in the house so much shit needs to be fixed but shes broke and spends her money on other things she owes me well over bucks on expenses that ill probably never get back half the windows in the house the glass is broken she doesnt even pay for the house her year old father does who is also stressed and shouldnt be dealing with these things at his age anyway many more details i could probably type for hours but hopefully this sums up most of it how do i copelive with this for the next years with out being miserable and angry all the time,1,0

friends best friends rest kinda yk theyd figure without dont know cope,high schooler im a high schooler in his last year of school matric i dont even know why im here but maybe some people may relate to my little story and possibly even help the past couple weeks of my life have been well fair to say pretty sht schools basically taken over every minute of my time but that isnt even the worst issue its that today ive had my first mental breakdown in years forming backstory we moved provinces when i was a kid because my dad was abusive to my mom and sister and they had finalized the divorce we all felt more comfortable being as far away from him as possible we were not financially well off we stayed in a tiny cramped house for quite a long time me and my family were always in eachothers faces my mental health declined then and thats the lowest its been that school friendships my health and everything deteriorated my mental health completely and i attempted s eventually got sent to a youth ward for weeks to figure that sht out with a bunch of other random kids under i was the youngest at abt the rest of the kids either were having mental health problems as well or were drug addicts so that was a fun weeks of my life in which i also got punched in the face by a drug addict who was eventually we moved to a bigger place this was about my mom had been saving and had just got a much higher paying job the last yrs have been pretty good here and being in the countryside away from the city has been healing in so many ways on the school side when we moved to the new place in i got sent to a private school in the area which was more of a public school with higher prices theyd get the worse teachers imaginable but the community and my friends there were probably the best ive had in my yrs of life and i do miss it but after the blatant racism me and my friends went through at that school i and a few of my buddies decided to leave i still have some really good friends there and we keep in touch from time to time in grade after term one at that school wasnt going great academically and my teachers pretty much werent teaching us the standards i found a new school it was alot further away from the house but we heard pretty good reviews from other parents there wont name the new school so lets just call it super fancy place super fancy place was pretty super fancy compared to the schools i went to before pretty much where the well off individuals send their kids my single mom has always pushed so hard for us and worked or jobs just to get me in past few yrs have been pretty good my mental health sky rocketed ive been making connections started businesses and made friends in a bunch of random places my family started a small farm on the new property as one does in the countryside where we handle livestock weve just started a new hatchery but ill get back that this later i also started a photography business and have been building my portfolio for about years now and i have a pretty good following on instagram we work events car shows and ive got a few of my buds to join me as well from time to time had other business ideas which failed but yk we move it happens nthn much i can do thats pretty much where the good news ends since about december last yr my mental health has been slowly declining once more nthn specific right it got so bad that i broke up with my gf of abt a year because i couldnt handle all of ts mentally but it wasnt that bad just a bit overwhelmed and some relationship issues ye school stuff starts feel free to skip this part its long ah now start of matric till now been abt or months i feel like im constantly fighting with teachers over the dumbest of things not even schoolwork all the time like i said i do photography the school knows this and they tell me and my buds to do photography from time to time for the schools articles we willingly do it even though it takes up hours of our time sometimes even days on big events but they dont credit us nor pay us fair enough i do it as a courtesy and maybe theyll add something for my application to uni college if youre from the us the other week when i was doing photography for one of the plays as ive done for the past yrs at this new school a teacher comes up to me a teacher ive never interacted with in my life and starts fighting with me and telling me to leave the balcony where all the lights sound and equipment is kept and used for plays im like okay but its kinda crazy i just wasted hrs of my time waiting for it to start i wasnt going to drive all the way back home which is abt an hour in traffic just to drive back so i stayed at the school anyways we argue for a bit and i just decide to leave this was like min before the play was abt to start more information i received later on this teacher is that shes dating one of the other teachers and that shes like this everyday and just has a horrible attitude problem idc i never have to speak to her again my other teachers ive been fighting with because of academics and them not giving me marks because they dont understand basic english and i used different words in a test that mean the same thing anyways idc abt that too much just want to vent abt one more teacher my additional language teacher in the country im from we all have to take an additional language she cares more about finishing the syllabus than actually teaching the book we have for the yr shes finished in the first term of grade everyday for the past term shes been giving us abt chapter of questions to do per day each one takes abt and hour or so to finish which leaves little to no time for the other subjects she doesnt even teach she reads the book during class and then tells us to do the questions which we evidently are never able to finish in class since she doesnt teach i go for outside tuition as well i was speaking to the other kids from other schools at tuition and they said theyve only just done up to chapter and theyre teacher is actually taking them through the book explaining and helping them and then going over the questions and everything as the teacher should be doing ours not so much and its both teachers in the school its between having a teacher that doesnt teach at all who smiles at you from time to time or the other teacher who teachers for abt a minute of the lesson whos always grumpy both teachers are well over and i dont want to make this an age thing but i think they just dont care abt the students and then they blame us and wonder why our grade are so bad and the grade average is horrible if you skipped then start from here over the past couple weeks school has been proper hectic weve had tests and assignments due pretty much everyday and i havent had a proper sleep in weeks ive pretty much stopped my other businesses cause i dont have time including my farm responsibilities but obviously still have to care for the animals fair enough its matric have to put in as much as i can this yr the hatchery i was talking about earlier at this point is going horrendously weve had horrible hatch rates due to suppliers and i think thats also compiling onto the stress but weve drastically cut back on that now cause were losing too much money ive also ended long lasting friendships because we couldnt see eye to eye on things all of this compiled and yes im leaving alot out cause this is already very very long everything compiled is just too much for me mentally i cant cope i feel so overwhelmed and stressed everyday for reference im a car guy ive built a turbo fez which is pretty fast and i used to race it i love that car so much because when ive had a tough day driving faster than i should calms me down and lets me forget abt all of this sht for a second its not the fastest thing but it gets the job done over the past weeks i physically can not get the thought of me ending it all out of my head and yes ik i dont have the worst life i have a loving caring family which is why i havent done anything yet i cant stand the thought of them seeing me yk but over the past few weeks i keep thinking itd be so fckn easy to just go out at am when no ones around get up to abt and swerve into a pole itd be so fckn easy to end it ye thered be people who missed me but theyd get over it i only really have one or really good friends best friends the rest are just kinda there yk but theyd figure it out without me i just dont know what to do and how to cope,1,1

didnt work tried multiple times lots talks wouldnt change one day group call friendly trouble maker wasnt close attended club mike marisa vented troublemaker call eliza plan made going plan prank

friends call include name anything left call call busted sofia officially friend group next year came around mike moved elite private school marisa plus fourth girl havent named story lets call bell friended sofia since changed however friend group b main one one day field trip sofia new friend call samantha samantha past rocky relationship sofia today samantha look like mad sofia refused talk wasnt business belle wasnt able go field trip marisa field trip sofia vented us samantha verbally abusing fg shocked asked explain sofia explained samantha would randomly dump trauma problems sofia context samantha suicidal problems home sofia obviously feels bad put crap months wanting abandon best friend day thought maybe sofia escape toxicity formally invited sit us lunch recap talk day came sofia arrived table belle marisa waiting cleared everything told invited sit us whenever wanted basically back main fg day even told current crushes show trusted shared things seem going smoothly samantha started show uninvited tables conversations wouldnt issue asked constantly tried include fg like presence caved idea staying partially close us problems arose samantha appears arrogant always telling friend marisa like work math since think though need test im ready though think got group b got group group system classify smartness future applications higher letter meant greater opportunities applications constantly arrogant belittling marisa obviously like decided anything though problems home suicidal friend ship drama add sofia stated close occasionally listened sofia tell bad things samantha done like make fun friends skills sports stuff even though learning disability general talks sht friends often today sofia sent screenshots shots messages samantha samantha going unalive good guy threatening stuff us done things exfriends past also scary samantha predicts stuff like peoples absence stuff scary threatening kill fg threatening us general allow make awkward seem look like forced friendship onto us thing dont problem allowing friend group thing shes inviting friendships made memories close relationships threats ps samantha gone counseling stoped attention annoying advice,my friend wants to be closer to my friend group and after days threatens to unalive herself hi im a minor who identifies as sheher and will not be disclosing my age better grab some popcorn cause your in for a treat recently a girl in my class who im not close to but friends to recently decided to tell us that she will unalive herself if she is not included in my close friend group abbreviation fg aka most people would call it fg a it all started when last year my close guy friend we will call him mike mike has this mentally challenged cousin how attended my school and would constantly stalk my fg my close fg consists of girls including me mike and would constantly saying and do things that disturbed us like how he would rape us and other things i will not mention so of the of us in the fg we will call marisa and sofia decided to report mikes cousins behavior to one of his teachers next period they pulled me and sofia instead of marisa since they couldnt find her or something idk they sent us to the principals office and made us talk face to face with mikes cousin after that the assistant principal called our parents sofia and i are straight a students however sofia has very strict parents so this instantly went south for her her parents forbade her to see my friend mike ever again while my mom told me to be careful so after this incident everything turned upside down sofia started to act mean towards mike always verbally pushing him out of our lunch table saying stuff like you ugly rat we dont want you here and just generally being bully and at the same time verbally hurting us too again we didnt want any trouble and report this to the school so we stayed silent for a while after planing in my group chat we decided to confront sofia about her behavior it didnt work we tried multiple times and had lots of talks with her but she wouldnt change so one day i was in a group call with a friendly trouble maker who wasnt that close to me but attended my club mike and marisa vented to the troublemaker which we will call eliza and then a plan was made we were going to plan to prank sofia by pretending to be her stalker yes this wasnt the best plan but we were pissed at sofia since sofia didnt have elizas number they decided to use her number to pretend to be a secret admirer halfway through the plan i realized what we had done i realized that is we were caught i was surely done for after rambling to my friends in the call to not include my name in anything i left the call after that the call was busted and then sofia was officially out of the friend group the next year came around and mike moved to an elite private school so it was just marisa and i plus the fourth girl i havent named in this story lets call her bell we friended sofia again since she has changed however she was more of in friend group b than in the main one one day we had a field trip and sofia now has a new friend we will call her samantha samantha is the past had a rocky relationship with sofia today samantha had look like she was mad at sofia and refused to talk to her but that wasnt my business belle wasnt able to go to the field trip so it was just me and marisa in the field trip sofia vented to us about how samantha was verbally abusing her and her own fg shocked we asked her to explain sofia then explained how samantha would randomly dump her trauma and problems on sofia for context samantha is suicidal and has problems at home so sofia obviously feels bad for her and put up with her crap for months not wanting to abandon her best friend after that day we thought that maybe sofia should escape that toxicity and formally invited her to sit with us at lunch to recap and talk the day came and sofia arrived at the table where belle marisa and i were waiting we cleared everything up and told her she was invited to sit with us whenever she wanted and basically she was back to my main fg that day we even told her our current crushes to show her that we trusted her again and she shared hers too things seem to be going smoothly until samantha started to show up uninvited to our tables and conversations this wouldnt be an issue if she had just asked but she constantly tried to include herself in our fg but we did not like her presence so we caved into the idea of her staying partially close to us again problems arose and samantha appears to be very arrogant always telling my friend marisa what to do like you should work on in math since i think though need it for the test im ready though or i think you got group b and i got group a this group system was to classify your smartness for future applications and a higher letter meant greater opportunities for applications she was constantly arrogant and belittling marisa and obviously we did not like it we decided not to do anything though as again she has problems at home and is suicidal and friend ship drama will only add to it sofia and i stated to be very close again and i occasionally listened to sofia tell me about all the bad things samantha has done like make fun her other friends skills in sports and stuff even though she has a learning disability but in general talks sht about her own friends often so today sofia sent me screenshots of shots of messages between her and samantha and how samantha is going to unalive herself to be the good guy and is threatening to do stuff to us as she has done things to her exfriends in the past also it is scary how samantha predicts stuff like peoples absence and stuff its scary what do i do now she is threatening to kill herself over my fg and threatening us in general do we allow her in that will only make it awkward as she will seem to look like she forced the friendship onto us the thing is i dont have a problem with allowing her into our friend group but the thing is shes just inviting herself friendships are made through memories and close relationships not through threats ps samantha has gone to counseling but stoped because the attention was annoying any advice now,1,1

recognize ive hated never degree self hate went adolescent youre annoying ugly one wants adult dont make life work worthless partner amazing fills words affirmation helps cant really help big things like assignments sometimes attempt help harm good also desperately need change medication anxiety department well medicated adhd doctors hours away work go school days week kinda hard get things scheduled brings lowest point ive ever present day credit semester one roommates served eviction notice us wouldnt remove covering bills months struggling find internship degree program panic attacks every time woke went sleep left alone thought good keeping assignments better didnt realize sacrificing health even get done withdrew semester fully intend going back sound delusional say dont think best get downward spiral brain years feel like im repeating patterns needed something break cycle need know without sick stressed thats ive years straight body doesnt know happy point killing trying please everyone else working hard dont get happiness im almost dead dont know maybe im rock bottom mania someone tell ruined entire life anyways im asking think know need get survival mode already therapist talk routines lot routines get overtaken stressful events get lost hate keeping routine ironically seems routine keep im sitting right righting anxiousness heart dont even know get started without basis day anxiety attack school bills words wisdom,chronic stress among other things is destroying me my posts are usually long and drawn out with a lot of background so please bare with me i came to the realization last year that i have been in survival mode since i got ill with my chronic diseases at pots and amps i am now i think that survival mode caused me to have chronic stress i didnt realize until i found myself in moments where i dont really have anything pressing to do but my body still feels like im about to get crushed by some lurking responsibility or disastrous event i barely got through high school being sick i moved out at and am still barely making it by i go to school all week then work all weekend i have animals and bills terrible roommates issues and friends who dont understand why i cant be there for them anymore i lost lbs since joining college and im only in my second year i noticed i forget to eat shower and just generally taking care of myself to take care of other things like school work or paperwork eventually everything spiraled and i was procrastinating big things to take care of small things just so i could feel like i was doing something then the big things pile up into a big problem that requires even more steps than before when i try to do things i enjoy i find i cant i went on vacation in the summertime and still had panic attacks every night about starting school i go out on dates with my partner and i feel like im not even there because im so in my head i hang out with friends they get upset i cant give them my full attention and suddenly im not getting invited to things anymore on my birthday i spent it crying in the shower when my friends were making me a birthday cake i never got to see because i was too broken down to talk to anyone my attitude both inwards and outwards is that of someone i dont recognize ive hated myself before but never to this degree my self hate went from an adolescent youre annoying and ugly and no one wants you to an adult if you dont make your life work then you are worthless my partner is the amazing he fills me with words of affirmation and helps where he can but he cant really help me with big things like assignments and sometimes his attempt to help does more harm than good i also desperately need a change of medication in the anxiety department as well as being medicated for adhd but when your doctors are hours away and you work and go to school days a week from its kinda hard to get things scheduled that brings me to the lowest point ive ever been in present day i had a credit semester one of our roommates had been served with an eviction notice from us and wouldnt remove himself we had been covering his bills for months before that i was struggling to find an internship for my degree program i was having panic attacks every time i woke up went to sleep or was left alone i thought i was doing good because i was keeping up in assignments better but i didnt realize that i was sacrificing my health even more to get them done so i withdrew for the semester i fully intend on going back but does it sound delusional to say that i dont think i can do my best until i get out of this downward spiral my brain has been in for years i feel like im repeating the same patterns and i needed to do something to break the cycle i need to know who i am without just being sick or stressed out and thats all ive been for years straight my body doesnt know how to be happy what is the point of killing myself trying to please everyone else and working so hard if i dont get any happiness until im almost dead i dont know maybe im just having some rock bottom mania and someone will tell me i just ruined my entire life anyways im asking what to do now i think i know i need to get out of survival mode but how do i do that i already have a therapist we talk routines a lot but my routines get overtaken by stressful events and then they get lost then i hate myself for not keeping the routine ironically that seems to be the only routine i can keep but im sitting here right now righting this with this anxiousness in my heart but i dont even know how to get started without the basis of my day being an anxiety attack about school of bills any words of wisdom,4,4

like physically tired irritable ended requesting lab work cortisol like thought x gp didnt recommend medication thats wanted told need relax despite working times week lifting weights light cardio well eating clean couldnt lose weight hair still thinning nails breaking left right point desperate find fix ended going endocrinologist since didnt levels showed cushings messed thyroid wasnt much told relax time late november early december since im google scholar learned ashwagandha way naturally lower cortisol dismissed ive studied science past years current schooling second science degree evidence anecdotal factual enough persuade take wanted prescribed cortisol suppressor thyroid enhancer something proven work chance one day passed vitamin aisle target saw goli ashwagandha gummies bought figured didnt work least id get candy lo behold worked took suggested religiously put closet id never forget slowly noticed pants werent tight less irritable thought way probably recovering sleep loss newborn realized still wasnt sleeping factors listed earlier contributed stress weeks ago early january decided weigh noticed dropped pounds month looked mirror bald spots gone hair wasnt like hay nails also longer chipped anywhere realize also could post birth issues kids close age havent aged much years body would respond drastically different births idk im much happier starting gummy vitamins baseline always content ive never depressed anxious feel like million bucks whether gummys figure worth sharing anyone similar situation even placebo effect also ob test cortisol last week results came back normal,stress related weight issues in the summer of i realized that i was very stressed i just gave birth to my third child in may and have a now and year old my place of employment that i worked at announced it was closing in july i was preparing to start the fall semester in courses that were all hard science based i was pounds heavier than i usually am my nails were brittle and my hair was thinning despite this never happening post partum with my two other children i would wake up exhausted it would take a long time to fall asleep if i didnt take melatonin and i was easily becoming anxious i was on the job hunt and knew i had to lose weight i know it sounds crazy but my job is in cocktailing and we typically have to be in good shape while my husband was doing his best there were just certain things he couldnt help me overcome physically mentally i felt fine no depression or anything like that i was just so physically tired and irritable because of it i ended up requesting lab work for my cortisol and just like i thought it was x what it should have been my gp didnt recommend any medication thats what i wanted and just told me i need to relax despite working out times a week lifting weights and doing light cardio as well as eating very clean i just couldnt lose any weight my hair was still thinning and my nails were breaking left and right by this point was desperate to find a fix i ended up going to an endocrinologist and since i didnt have levels that showed cushings or a messed up thyroid there wasnt much he told me to do other than relax more at this time it was late november early december since im a google scholar i learned that ashwagandha was a way to naturally lower cortisol i dismissed this because ive studied science for the past years my current schooling is for a second science degree the evidence was too anecdotal and not factual enough to persuade me to take it i wanted to be prescribed a cortisol suppressor or a thyroid enhancer something that was proven to work but by chance one day i passed the vitamin aisle at target and saw the goli ashwagandha gummies and bought them because i figured if it didnt work at least id get to have some candy lo and behold it worked i took them as suggested religiously i put them in my closet so id never forget slowly i noticed that my pants werent so tight and i was less irritable i thought there was no way i was probably just recovering from the sleep loss from having a newborn but then i realized i still wasnt sleeping and all the other factors i listed earlier that contributed to my stress were the same a few weeks ago in early january i decided to weigh myself and noticed that i dropped pounds in a month i looked in the mirror and my bald spots were gone and my hair wasnt like hay and my nails were also longer and not chipped anywhere i realize that i also could just have post birth issues but my kids are close in age i havent aged that much in years that my body would respond so drastically different than my other births idk im so much happier after starting these gummy vitamins my baseline before was always content ive never been depressed or anxious and now i feel like a million bucks whether or not its because of the gummys i figure its worth sharing to anyone in a similar situation even if its just a placebo effect also i had my ob test my cortisol last week and the results came back normal,3,3

things i have but i have found no joy in doing so this will be a lengthy post and i greatly appreciate anyone who takes the time to read it and respond or can give any advice or insight first i will need to give some context and share some details that may seem irrelevant but i think they could have played a role in why i am experiencing the problems i am experiencing today in june i went to thailand with my friends for a month on one of the first nights i was there i had sex with a girl from thailand not a ladyboy or sex worker btw without a condom when telling my friends after they tried scaring me by telling me i was going to get an std this started to put fear in the back of my mind for the rest of the trip before going to thailand we had gotten our vaccines for typhoid and hepa i had remembered one of my friends saying that one of the people administering his vaccines saying it wasnt necessary to get hepb vaccine however dont have unprotected sex with locals as there is a higher chance of getting it there than it would back home once i remembered this i started to fear i had contracted hepb even though i had no symptoms of it at all or any of std about two weeks later before going out for dinner we had some down time where everyone was either sleeping or just resting before going out for food i remember during this downtime i was alone with my thoughts and began to convince myself i had hepb i didnt have it im just an idiot i had really convinced myself that i had it and began to fear the worst i experienced this sinking feeling in my chest never experienced before or times when thinking my life was ruined i have this virus that cant be cured i wasnt visibly in fear or panicking just in my head i was my friends were unaware that i had convinced myself into believing this nor could they see it from the outside in we then went out for dinner in an italian restaurant like we did most nights this is when my first problem happened i ordered pizza like normal and after taking a bite or two of the pizza my throat started to tighten up making it hard to breathe i was confused when this happened as i have never experienced this sensation ever before in my life it was scary and worrying it was like i was having an allergic reaction to the pizza a food i have eaten my whole life i also dont have any food allergies this feeling of my throat tightening up and difficulty breathing lasted for about hours not a panic attack i thought this might be a once off thing and went out that night drinking and had no further issues i then woke up the next morning and started experiencing the same problem my throat would physically tighten up and make it hard to breathe usually lasting hours at a time and was happening several times a day this continued for the rest of the holiday and for weeks when i got back home i must note when i came home i did a std test and had no std i believe that night when i had convinced myself i had hepb and got these sinking sensations in my chest is what triggered everything i have experienced since as strange as it sounds i believe i somehow messed up my body that day by believing that i had hepb and my life was ruined even though i did a std test and i know that i dont have it all my problems havent went away it also seems that food triggers these issues i have since been to an

mental health growth woman ive learned much human relationship would considered covid relationship met got married nine months later life crazy time ability fall love toxic men alltime high getting married time worst decision ive ever made idea getting man next years left husband year half marriage finally able see recognize treated family saw quickly wanted life relationship got point didnt want acknowledge problems certainly didnt want talk believe best could marriage really put effort loving wife without ever healthy marriage displayed gotten point becoming really angry world really stressed wouldnt talk faults time knowing would handled things differently really love didnt love anymore wasnt taking care time realized unhealthy relationship knew potential person healthy relationship someone didnt treat like garbage didnt realize unhealthy toxic initially realize wanted leave quickly could knowing thats deserved life left almost two years ago healthiest relationship life someone loves way someone love another person ive man six months known years good friends really long time decided try dating months ago best decision ive ever made problem ex husband moved old address andfor begin divorce process need current residential address ive reached times year release info ignores messages every time want go smoothly possible inexpensive possible temporarily government assistance thousands dollars lengthy divorce reason context husband kids dont share property assets joint bank accounts anything nature share last name id like give back feel like ill never able get marriage ill never able eventually get married right man deserves loved ex husband making harder supposed making incredibly angry would immature yet doesnt surprise makes sad,i feel like ill never get out of my marriage i feel like im never going to get out of my marriage i left my toxic husband back in january of and have been living separately for almost two years leaving him was the best decision ive ever made for my mental health and my growth as a woman and ive learned so much about myself as a human being my relationship with him would have been considered a covid relationship where we met in and got married nine months later my life was crazy at the time and my ability to fall in love with toxic men was at an alltime high getting married at the time was the worst decision ive ever made because i had no idea what i was getting into with this man for the next few years i left my husband about a year and half into our marriage i finally was able to see and recognize how i was being treated by him and his family and how i saw quickly that i wanted more for my life and our relationship than he did it got to a point where he didnt want to acknowledge the problems we were having and he most certainly didnt want to talk about it with me i believe i did the best i could in my marriage and i really did put an effort in as a loving wife without ever having a healthy marriage displayed to me it had gotten to a point where he was becoming really angry at the world and he was really stressed out but wouldnt talk to me about it i had faults of my own at the time and knowing what i do now i would have handled things differently with him because i really did love him he just didnt love himself anymore and wasnt taking care of himself at the time i was when i realized i was in a very unhealthy relationship and i knew i had more potential as a person and to be in a healthy relationship with someone who didnt treat me like garbage i didnt realize it was unhealthy and toxic initially but once i did realize it i wanted to leave as quickly as i could knowing thats not what i deserved in my life i left him almost two years ago and i am now in the healthiest relationship of my life with someone who loves me the way someone should love another person ive been with this man for six months and have known him for years so we have been good friends for a really long time we decided to try dating months ago and its been the best decision ive ever made the problem is my ex husband has moved from our old address andfor me to begin my divorce process i need his current residential address ive reached out to him a few times over the year for him to release that info to me but he ignores my messages every time i just want this to go as smoothly as possible and as inexpensive as possible because i am temporarily on government assistance and do not have thousands of dollars for a lengthy divorce for no reason for context my husband and i do not have kids we dont share property or any assets no joint bank accounts or anything of that nature we just share a last name which id like to give him back because of all of this i feel like ill never be able to get out of my marriage and ill never be able to eventually get married again but to the right man who deserves to be loved by me my ex husband is making this harder than its supposed to be and its making me incredibly angry that he would be so immature about it and yet that doesnt surprise me it just makes me sad,3,0

way third back story false positive lyme tests never looked back everyday look mirror look like got sleep went sleep doctor got sleep study done lab said didnt sleep apnea took home sleep study year later said mild sleep apnea events per hour many sent cpap dont even know im using properly havent really given chance another big thing fatigue started moved basement months hit found mold basement

fourth back story year half ago started getting stomach pains diarrhea fast forward last month found cdiff toxins stomach taken antibiotics inflammation im stuck post infectious ibs live cant live fatigue used full life aware longer energized lastly anxiety around time fatigue started stressed didnt clear path life became insecure scared people would think months fatigue started got terrible panic attacks couldnt even breath happened first time life havent one since times anxiety runs family brothers extreme anxiety disorders along dad recently mental breakdown hospitalized months used scared every second everyday im terrified exhausted day everyday went years without missing days row without working every single week showed felt lifting biggest passion felt great year slowly fallen

competition university rich investors yet cant seem put mind together work towards even though know much money id make successful id cant realizing maybe im broken person im usually redditor nothing else turn dont even know anyone help please talk need something someone,i need urgent help back story im years old and a senior in college years ago i remember to the day july th i woke up extremely fatigued i thought maybe i was just sick or something and id get better and it never did i was working out days a week for years at that point i continued to battle through the fatigue for years and then the third year i just couldnt handle it anymore i realized i couldnt keep living exhausted everyday so i decided to go to every doctor i could possibly find i went to an allergist endocrinologist gastroenterologist ent primary care doctor psychiatrist sleep doctor and therapist you name it second back story around the time the fatigue started i was getting anxious because for the first time i was out of school because i took a gap year between high school and college and didnt have a structured life of getting up the same time everyday and constantly doing things i felt fine for the first year and a half then that summer i woke up one day and everything changed during that gap year before the fatigue i did a couple cycles of sarms and mk felt great and was highly motivated as always the fatigue didnt start til a few months after the sarms and its been years since taking them so i thought there was no way that was the cause and my friends who also took them are fine fast forward to last year i felt like crap and wanted to get jacked again so i took test e only for months and i still felt completely exhausted so i dont think its some sort of endocrine issue although a lot of people who wake up randomly one day fatigued say they ended up having a tumor on their pituitary gland which just so happens i have low fsh and my hdl is low which im not saying i have a tumor but there could be a pituitary issue causing me to feel this way third back story i had false positive lyme tests when i was and never have looked back into it everyday i look into the mirror and look like i got no sleep i went to a sleep doctor and got a sleep study done in a lab and he said i didnt have sleep apnea i took an at home sleep study a year later that said i had mild sleep apnea at events per hour which is not many they sent me a cpap which i dont even know if im using properly and havent really given it a chance another big thing is that when the fatigue started i had just moved down my basement for months and then it hit i have found mold in my basement and other spots in the house i also lived in an apartment for months last year which was also very unclean though and i was going home constantly i have red eyes and congestive which would line up with allergies im so fed up that i just bought a mycotoxin urine test for mold yesterday which ill complete this week fourth back story about a year and a half ago i started getting stomach pains and diarrhea fast forward to last month i found out it was cdiff toxins in stomach i had taken and antibiotics and the inflammation is down now im just stuck with post infectious ibs i can live with that i cant live with fatigue i used to be full of life and aware i no longer am energized lastly anxiety around the time the fatigue started i was stressed because i didnt have a clear path for life and became insecure and scared of what people would think months after the fatigue started i got some terrible panic attacks where i couldnt even breath happened for the first time in my life i havent had one since those times anxiety runs in my family with both of my brothers have extreme anxiety disorders along with my dad who just recently had a mental breakdown and was hospitalized for months i used to not be scared every second of everyday now im terrified and exhausted all day everyday i went years without missing more than days in a row without working out every single week i showed up i felt lifting was my biggest passion because i felt great this year i slowly have fallen out of working out i dont even do it anymore but its still on my mind im just too fatigued i was so motivated for even the last years but this year the rd year i have became depressed because i dont see myself getting better is this all because anxiety i also have recorded my sleep and i dont sit still for more than minutes all night and always have nightmares maybe im just an anxious idiot but how could this all be anxiety and do i have hope of beating it i still somewhat manage university i have almost straight as with b and am taking credits which is a lot i just have lost all hope i started going to church to give my life some sort of meaning but it hasnt helped very much ive started reading books like meditations by marcus aurelius about stoicism to try to change my philosophy but it hasnt quite worked i havent felt endorphins in years i just want to feel not exhausted ive been laying in my room every night with a gun to my head i cant keep living an exhausted life i have to wake up every morning and get reminded that ill never be able to do the things i love and chase my dreams because im exhausted i want to die i have suicidal thoughts all day and just want to be energetic again my girlfriend well exgirlfried now hates me i have put my stress on her making her life worse and she later just ended up getting with some other guy while still in contact with me and the things ive been going through i have stopped talking to her and yet shell still call me i just want to chase goals make money start a business i have a literally full website and won my business competition at my university with rich investors and yet i cant seem to put my mind together to work towards it even though i know how much money id make and how successful id be i just cant and am realizing that now maybe im just a broken person im not usually a redditor i just have nothing else to turn to i dont even know if anyone here can help me but please talk to me i need something or someone,0,4
